# 📘 Module 7 — Exploring Generative AI & Agentic AI (Approx. 60mins)
---

**Goal:** Help learners understand Generative AI, Agentic AI, how they differ, their opportunities and risks, and how to collaborate responsibly with AI that can act autonomously.

---

## **Slide 17 — What is Generative AI?**

### **Key Points**

- Generative AI creates **new content**: text, images, audio, video, or code.
- It **learns patterns from large datasets** and produces outputs that resemble human-created content.
- Requires **human guidance**: prompts, context, and iteration are essential for useful results.

### **Real-World Examples**

- **Text & Conversation:** ChatGPT, Claude, Bard
- **Images:** DALL·E, MidJourney, Stable Diffusion
- **Music & Audio:** AIVA, Soundraw
- **Coding Assistance:** GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT code suggestions

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Ask learners:
    
    > “Have you ever used AI to create something from scratch? What worked well, and what didn’t?”
    > 
- Emphasize: Generative AI **amplifies creativity** but doesn’t replace human vision or judgment.
- Optional mini-demo: Generate a short paragraph or image live to show process and iteration.

## **Slide 18 — Understanding Agentic AI**

### **Key Points**

- Agentic AI can **act autonomously**, make decisions, and execute sequences of tasks with minimal human input.
- These systems are more independent than standard AI tools, functioning as **agents** toward specific goals.

### **Examples of Agentic AI**

- Autonomous robots performing deliveries or warehouse work
- AI assistants managing complex schedules
- AI workflow agents that analyze data and take sequential actions

### **How Agentic AI Differs from Standard AI**

| Feature | Standard AI | Agentic AI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requires human input | Yes | Sometimes operates independently |
| Makes decisions | Follows prompts | Prioritizes and sequences actions |
| Autonomy | Low | Medium to high |
| Examples | ChatGPT, DALL·E | Auto-GPT, autonomous drones, AI workflow bots |

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Emphasize: Agentic AI is **powerful but requires oversight**.
- Ask learners:
    
    > “What benefits and challenges might arise if AI could make autonomous decisions?”
    >

## **Slide 19 — Opportunities & Risks**

### **Opportunities**

- Automates repetitive tasks to **boost efficiency**
- Enhances creativity through **new ideas and content**
- Supports decision-making via **data analysis and simulations**

### **Risks**

- Autonomous actions may produce **unintended consequences**
- Bias, errors, or misaligned goals can be amplified
- Raises **ethical, privacy, and security concerns**

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Use examples learners can relate to:
    
    > “An agentic AI scheduling meetings could double-book appointments or miss priorities without human checks.”
    > 
- Encourage discussion on **balancing autonomy with human oversight**.

## **Slide 20 — Best Practices for Working with Generative & Agentic AI**

### **Guidelines**

1. **Define Clear Goals:** Be explicit about desired outcomes.
2. **Monitor Outputs:** Review AI-generated content or decisions before acting.
3. **Iterate & Refine:** Adjust prompts or parameters for improved results.
4. **Understand Limitations:** Know what AI can and cannot do.
5. **Apply Ethics & Privacy:** Protect sensitive data, ensure fairness, and avoid harm.

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Reinforce: Responsible use is critical—**humans are ultimately accountable**.
- Optional demo: Show content generation and discuss how iterative refinement and oversight improve outcomes.

---

## **Activity 1 — Generative AI Experiment** *(15–20 min)*

### **Instructions**

1. Learners select a project: text, image, music, or coding.
2. Generate content using a Gen AI tool.
3. Iteratively refine outputs based on reflection.

### **Debrief Questions**

- What did AI do well?
- Where did it misunderstand instructions?
- How could human input improve the results?
- How might this content be applied responsibly in real life?

---

## **Activity 2 — Agentic AI Scenario Simulation** *(Optional, 15 min)*

### **Scenario Example**

- An agentic AI is assigned to schedule appointments, send reminders, and manage a small project autonomously.

### **Instructions**

- Learners identify:
    - Potential benefits
    - Possible errors or risks
    - Oversight strategies

### **Debrief Questions**

- When should humans intervene?
- How can unintended consequences be prevented?
- What checks and balances are necessary for safety and accountability?

---

## **Slide 21 — Transition & Reflection**

### **Key Points**

- Generative AI enhances **creation and ideation**.
- Agentic AI enables **autonomous action**.
- Skills from previous modules—**clear prompts, iteration, ethical awareness, and human oversight**—apply directly.

### **Facilitator Prompt**

- Ask learners:
    
    > “Thinking about your daily AI use, which tasks could safely be delegated to an agentic AI, and where would human judgment remain critical?”
    >

## **Module 7 — Speaker Notes**

### **Slide 17 — Generative AI**

- “Generative AI can produce text, images, music, and code. It’s amazing for brainstorming and prototyping—but it still needs your guidance and critical thinking.”

### **Slide 18 — Agentic AI**

- “Agentic AI acts as an autonomous assistant. It can plan, execute, and decide—but its autonomy requires careful oversight and responsibility.”

### **Slide 19 — Opportunities & Risks**

- Discuss **benefits**: efficiency, creativity, insight
- Discuss **risks**: errors, bias, ethical challenges
- Encourage critical thinking: when and how to let AI act autonomously.

### **Slide 20 — Best Practices**

- Define goals, monitor outputs, iterate, understand limitations, and apply ethics and privacy safeguards.
- “Responsible use keeps AI as a tool for augmentation, not replacement.”
