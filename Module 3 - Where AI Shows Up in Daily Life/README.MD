# 📘 Module 3 — Where AI Shows Up in Daily Life(Approx. 60 min)
---

**Goal:** Help learners recognize how AI quietly influences daily routines and understand its cross-industry applications—often in ways that go unnoticed.

---

## **Slide 7 — Everyday AI**

### **AI in Your Daily Life**

AI is not just a futuristic concept from sci-fi or research labs—it’s embedded in everyday experiences. By the time you finish breakfast, check your phone, or commute to work, you’ve likely interacted with AI multiple times without realizing it.

AI’s strength lies in its **invisibility**: it quietly makes life smoother, faster, and more personalized.

### **Everyday Examples Learners Will Recognize**

- **Music & Movie Recommendations**
    
    Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, and TikTok analyze what you listen to, watch, or like, then suggest new content tailored to your tastes. These recommendations improve as AI learns from your patterns over time.
    
- **Navigation & Traffic**
    
    Google Maps, Waze, and other apps predict traffic, identify the fastest routes, and dynamically adapt to accidents, road closures, or delays.
    
- **Smart Home Assistants**
    
    Alexa, Google Home, and Siri process spoken commands, answer questions, adjust lights or thermostats, and manage shopping lists—all powered by AI.
    
- **Email & Messaging**
    
    Spam filters, phishing detection, predictive typing, and autocorrect rely on AI to handle massive volumes of messages efficiently and accurately.
    
- **Photo Cleanup & Enhancements**
    
    Smartphones use AI for portrait mode, auto-editing, facial recognition, and removing unwanted objects from photos.
