# 📘 Module 5 — Ethics & Responsible AI (Approx. 60mins)
---

**Duration:** ~60 minutes

**Goal:** Equip learners to identify ethical challenges in AI, understand bias and privacy risks, and explore strategies for responsible human + AI collaboration.

---

# **Slide 11 — Bias in AI**

### **Key Points**

- AI systems learn from **human-generated data**, so they can **inherit and amplify existing biases**.
- Bias can appear in various contexts:
    - Hiring and recruitment tools
    - Law enforcement and policing algorithms
    - Healthcare diagnostics
    - Financial services (credit scoring, lending)

### **Real-World Examples**

- A resume-screening AI may favor candidates similar to those previously hired, unintentionally disadvantaging women or minority groups.
- Facial recognition software may misidentify people of certain ethnicities more frequently than others.
- Predictive policing systems might disproportionately target neighborhoods historically over-policed.

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Discussion Prompt:
    
    > “Why can AI trained on biased data be harmful? Can anyone think of a real-world consequence?”
    > 
- Highlight: Detecting and addressing bias is a **critical step in responsible AI use**.
- Optional Demo: Show an example of biased AI output (e.g., facial recognition or hiring tool) to spark discussion.

### **Key Takeaway**

AI reflects the world it learns from—ethical awareness and careful oversight are essential to prevent harm.

# **Slide 12 — Privacy & Data Awareness**

### **Key Points**

- AI tools often **collect, analyze, and store personal data** to improve performance.
- Users must consider:
    - **What data** is being collected
    - **Where** it is stored and who can access it
    - **How** it is used or shared

### **Real-World Examples**

- Voice assistants recording conversations for feature improvements.
- Apps tracking location, activity, or habits for personalized recommendations.
- AI platforms storing user-generated content, including writing or images.

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Discussion Prompt:
    
    > “Have you ever read a privacy policy before using an AI app? How much do you think about what data you’re sharing?”
    > 
- Emphasize: Responsible AI use requires **awareness and informed consent**. Even free apps may collect sensitive data.

### **Key Takeaway**

Awareness of privacy and data practices is **essential for safe and responsible AI use**.

# **Slide 13 — Human + AI Collaboration**

### **Key Points**

- **Humans provide:**
    - Judgment and decision-making
    - Empathy and ethical reasoning
    - Context and nuance
    - Creativity and imagination
- **AI provides:**
    - Speed and scalability
    - Pattern recognition and data analysis
    - Assistance in repetitive or time-consuming tasks

### **Analogy**

> “Think of AI as a super-powered assistant: it can crunch numbers or generate options quickly, but humans decide the meaning, ethics, and priorities.”
> 

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Encourage learners to see AI as **augmenting human capability**, not replacing humans.
- Optional Example: AI generates a draft report; a human reviews it, interprets results, and decides next steps.

### **Key Takeaway**

Effective AI use combines **human judgment + AI efficiency**, creating better outcomes than either alone.

---

# **Activity — Debate: Life-Changing Decisions & AI**

### **Prompt**

> “Should AI ever make life-changing decisions without a human involved? Why or why not?”
> 

### **Instructions**

1. Split learners into two groups: **Yes** and **No**.
2. Each group brainstorms 2–3 supporting points.
3. Conduct a 5–10 minute debate.

### **Debrief Questions**

- “What risks arise if humans are removed from decision-making?”
- “Are there situations where AI might improve outcomes?”
- “How does collaboration reduce errors or harm?”

### **Optional Extension**

- Reflect on real-world examples (e.g., medical diagnoses, autonomous vehicles, financial decisions) to make discussion concrete.

---

# **Module 5 — Speaker Notes**

### **Slide 11 — Bias in AI**

- “AI can only be as fair as the data it learns from. Historical biases, incomplete data, or underrepresented voices can all lead to unfair outputs.”
- Encourage learners to ask:
    - Who created the data?
    - Whose perspectives are missing?
    - Could the AI make unfair decisions?

### **Slide 12 — Privacy**

- “Many AI tools use your personal data to improve performance. Being aware of what is collected, stored, or shared is part of responsible use.”
- Optional discussion: “Is it okay for an AI app to access your location or medical data? Why or why not?”

### **Slide 13 — Human + AI Collaboration**

- “Humans remain responsible for ethical decisions. AI can assist, but human judgment, context, and empathy are irreplaceable.”
- Reinforce: **responsible AI = human oversight + AI efficiency**.

### **Activity — Debate**

- “Use this debate to critically evaluate when AI should or shouldn’t have autonomy in important decisions.”
- Encourage learners to provide **evidence-based reasoning** and consider real-world implications.

### **Key Takeaways**

- AI is powerful, but **ethical awareness is critical**.
- Bias, privacy, and human oversight must guide AI use.
- Responsible AI is **collaborative, transparent, and accountable**.
