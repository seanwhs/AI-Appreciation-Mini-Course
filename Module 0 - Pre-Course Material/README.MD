# 📍 **6. Quick Vocabulary Primer**

These terms will come up during our sessions. Don’t memorize them — just notice them.

### **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**

Technology that recognizes patterns and makes predictions.

### **Machine Learning (ML)**

How AI learns from data instead of being given exact instructions.

### **Neural Networks**

Computer systems inspired by the human brain that detect patterns and relationships.

### **Generative AI**

AI that creates new content — text, images, music, code, etc.

### **Prompt**

The instruction or question you give an AI model.

### **Bias**

Unfair patterns or assumptions in AI outputs based on its training data.

### **Hallucination**

When AI confidently gives incorrect, missing, or made-up information.

---

# 📍 **7. Tech Setup Checklist**

Before class:

### ✔ Open an AI tool

Simply open the app or website — no pressure to “get it right.”

### ✔ Ask AI *one* simple question

Examples:

* “Explain the solar system as if I’m 10.”
* “Give me ideas for quick meals.”
* “Summarize this news headline.”

### ✔ Notice the AI’s response

Reflect:

* Was the answer clear?
* Was it correct?
* How could you ask the question differently?

This tiny exercise warms you up for the hands-on work we’ll be doing.

# 📍 **8. Pre-Course Activities (Choose 1–3)**

These short activities make the course more meaningful from day one.

---

## 🟦 **Activity A: AI Spotting Challenge**

For 24 hours, notice where AI appears around you.
Examples:

* Recommendation feeds
* Voice assistants
* Predictive text
* Spam filtering
* Auto-enhanced photos
* Smart home technology

**List what you spot:**

---

---

---

---

## 🟦 **Activity B: The Three-Prompt Test**

Choose any task and ask an AI tool the same thing **three different ways**.

Example task: “Help me plan a weekend trip.”

Prompt 1: “Plan a weekend trip.”
Prompt 2: “Create a two-day outdoor adventure itinerary for a family.”
Prompt 3: “I like photography and hiking. Suggest a weekend itinerary under $200.”

Compare:

* Which prompt produced the best result?
* Why?

This demonstrates how your instructions shape the output.

---

## 🟦 **Activity C: Evaluate AI’s Reliability**

Ask AI a question you already know the answer to.

Examples:

* “What is the capital of Japan?”
* “Who discovered penicillin?”

Then ask:

* “How confident are you in this answer?” (if available)
* “Show possible sources.”

Reflect:

* Was it correct?
* Would you trust AI with something important?
* When might you need to double-check?

---

# 📍 **9. Pre-Course Mindset Primer: How to Think About AI**

The following principles will help you get the MOST out of this course:

### ✦ AI is a tool, not a human

It doesn’t feel, think, or have opinions — it predicts patterns.

### ✦ AI is powerful *and* imperfect

It can draft, generate, summarize, and analyze —
but it can also be confidently wrong.

### ✦ Humans + AI > Humans alone

AI expands your capabilities, but *you* provide judgment, creativity, and context.

### ✦ You stay in control

You choose what to use, edit, trust, or ignore.

### ✦ Curiosity matters more than technical skill

Asking good questions is the most important skill you’ll learn.

---

# 📍 **10. Safety & Responsibility Preview**

We’ll explore these in depth, but here’s what to know now:

### ✔ Protect your personal information

Do *not* share passwords, addresses, financial details, or sensitive private content with AI tools.

### ✔ Double-check important outputs

AI can hallucinate, misinterpret, or oversimplify.

### ✔ Be cautious of bias

AI may replicate unfair patterns in its training data.
Use critical thinking — especially when AI outputs affect real people.

### ✔ Use AI to learn, not to cheat

AI should support your understanding, not replace your effort or integrity.
