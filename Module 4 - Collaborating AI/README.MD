# 📘 Module 4 — Collaborating With AI (Approx. 60 mins)
---

**Goal:** Teach learners how to interact effectively with AI, craft strong prompts, understand AI’s strengths and limitations, and practice hands-on collaboration.

---

## **Slide 9 — The Art of Prompting**

### **Why Prompting Matters**

AI is powerful—but it’s not psychic. The better your instructions, the better the results. Think of prompts as **directions for a teammate who only understands what you explicitly tell them**.

Clear, structured prompts help AI produce outputs that are useful, accurate, and creative.

---

### **Tips for Effective Prompts**

1. **Be Specific** – Clearly define what you want. Avoid vague requests.
2. **Provide Context** – Include background information or constraints to guide AI.
3. **State Your Goal** – Explain the purpose or intended audience for the output.
4. **Ask for a Format** – Specify how you want the answer: bullet points, essay, table, code, or story.

---

### **Examples**

- ❌ Weak: “Write about space.”
- ✔️ Strong: “Write a 150-word inspirational summary about why space exploration matters, written for high-school students.”

---

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Emphasize: AI only knows what you tell it—clear communication improves outcomes.
- Ask learners:
    
    > “Can you think of a time you asked an AI a vague question and got a confusing or unhelpful answer?”
    > 
- Optional demo: Show an AI responding to a vague vs. specific prompt.

## **Slide 10 — AI Strengths & Limits**

### **What AI Does Well**

- **Speed:** Processes large amounts of data faster than humans.
- **Summaries:** Condenses complex information into concise insights.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifies hidden relationships in data.
- **Brainstorming:** Generates multiple ideas quickly.
- **Creative Formatting:** Rewrites or organizes content efficiently.

### **Where AI Struggles**

- **Feelings & Intuition:** Cannot truly empathize or understand emotions.
- **Moral Judgment:** Cannot determine ethical choices independently.
- **Personal Experience:** Lacks lived experience or subjective understanding.
- **Up-to-the-Minute Facts:** Limited by training data and access to current information.

---

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Example:
    
    > “AI can summarize 50 research papers in minutes—but it won’t know which insights matter most to you personally.”
    > 
- Reinforce that AI is a **collaborator, not a replacement**.

## **Activity — Comparing Weak vs. Strong Prompts** *(15–20 min)*

### **Instructions**

1. Give AI **one vague prompt** and **one specific prompt**.
    - Vague: “Write a story.”
    - Specific: “Write a 200-word story about a robot who learns friendship, aimed at 12-year-olds.”
2. Compare the results side by side.

---

### **Debrief Questions**

- Which prompt produced a more useful or engaging result?
- What made the stronger prompt more effective (specificity, context, format)?
- How might iterative refinement improve the outputs further?

### **Optional Extension**

- Have learners refine AI’s output together, practicing **human + AI collaboration** through multiple iterations.

---

## **Speaker Notes — Module 4**

### **Slide 9 — The Art of Prompting**

- “AI is incredibly capable—but only responds well to clear instructions. Think of your prompts as instructions for a teammate who doesn’t read between the lines.”
- Discuss how specificity, context, stated goals, and format improve outputs.
- Encourage learners to share examples of past prompts that didn’t work and brainstorm improvements.

---

### **Slide 10 — Strengths & Limits**

- “AI excels at speed, data processing, and brainstorming—like a supercharged assistant.”
- “But AI doesn’t feel, can’t make moral decisions, and lacks personal experience. Recognize where human judgment is still essential.”
- Optional demo: Have AI attempt a “feelings-based” task, then discuss limitations.

---

### **Activity — Weak vs. Strong Prompts**

- Walk learners through testing vague vs. specific prompts.
- Highlight: specificity + context + format = better output.
- Emphasize iterative refinement as part of effective collaboration with AI.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- AI is a **collaborator, not a replacement**.
- Clear communication and understanding AI’s limitations maximize effectiveness.
- Iterative practice makes prompting intuitive and improves creative, useful outputs.

---

## **Module 4 Summary**

By the end of this module, learners will understand:

✔ How to craft **strong prompts** for better AI outputs

✔ How AI can support tasks **creatively and efficiently**

✔ Where AI is limited and why **human judgment is essential**

✔ How to practice **iterative collaboration** for optimal results
