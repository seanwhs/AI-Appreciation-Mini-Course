# 📘 Module 8 — Capstone Project: Human + AI Collaboration
---

**Goal:** Give learners a structured opportunity to apply all concepts learned—prompting, generative AI, agentic AI, ethics, privacy, and human oversight—by creating a meaningful project using AI.

---

## **Slide 22 — Capstone Overview**

### **Key Points**

- The capstone project is a **culmination of all modules**.
- Learners will **choose a project** and use AI as a collaborator.
- The focus is on **creativity, responsibility, and iterative refinement**.

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Emphasize: AI is a **partner, not a replacement**. Human vision, judgment, and ethical responsibility remain central.
- Highlight the **importance of reflection**: understanding what worked, what didn’t, and why.

---

## **Slide 23 — Project Options**

Learners may select a project based on interest and skills. Examples:

- **Creative Writing:** Poem, short story, or essay with AI-assisted brainstorming and drafting
- **Digital Art & Multimedia:** AI-generated images, video, or music composition
- **Learning & Study Tools:** Summaries, flashcards, interactive study guides
- **Professional Projects:** Business plans, marketing strategies, workflow automation
- **Personal Productivity:** AI-assisted planners, schedules, habit trackers

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Encourage learners to **pick something meaningful** to them personally or professionally.
- Optional: Showcase sample project ideas for inspiration.

## **Slide 24 — Capstone Guidelines**

1. **Human Vision Comes First:** Define your purpose, goals, and desired outcomes.
2. **Use AI Responsibly:** Apply principles from Modules 4–7 (prompting, iteration, ethical use, and oversight).
3. **Iterative Process:** Generate outputs, reflect, refine prompts, and improve results.
4. **Document Your Process:** Note successes, challenges, and ethical considerations.
5. **Prepare to Share:** Be ready to present or explain your project to peers.

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Remind learners: the process matters as much as the final product.
- Optional: Provide a **template for reflection**: project goals, AI role, iterations, ethical considerations, and lessons learned.

## **Slide 25 — Capstone Activity: Hands-On Work** *(60 min)*

### **Instructions**

1. **Plan Your Project** (10–15 min): Define scope, purpose, and AI’s role.
2. **Create with AI** (30–40 min): Use generative or agentic AI as appropriate.
3. **Reflect & Refine** (10–15 min): Evaluate AI outputs, refine prompts, and apply human judgment.

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Circulate to **provide guidance, answer questions, and encourage ethical reflection**.
- Encourage learners to **explore both creative and practical AI applications**.

---

## **Slide 26 — Reflection & Debrief**

### **Reflection Questions**

- How did AI enhance your project?
- Where did AI misunderstand or misalign with your intentions?
- What ethical or privacy considerations did you navigate?
- How would you apply this workflow to other projects or daily tasks?

### **Facilitator Notes**

- Encourage **peer discussion**: small groups or paired sharing.
- Highlight **lessons learned** from iterative collaboration with AI.

---

## **Slide 27 — Optional Showcase**

- Learners present projects to the group in **5-minute demos**.
- Emphasize: focus on **process, creativity, and responsible AI use**, not perfection.
- Optional peer feedback: “What worked well?” “What surprised you?” “What would you improve next time?”

---

## **Module 8 — Speaker Notes**

- “This capstone is your chance to integrate everything you’ve learned: prompting, generative AI, agentic AI, ethical awareness, and iterative collaboration.”
- “Remember, AI is a tool to **augment your ideas**—human judgment, creativity, and responsibility remain central.”
- Encourage **risk-taking and experimentation**, while applying **ethical guardrails**.
- Optional prompt for discussion:
    
    > “If this project were scaled to a real-world application, what additional ethical, privacy, or oversight measures would you implement?”
    > 

---

## **Module 8 — Key Takeaways**

- AI is a **collaborative partner**, not a replacement for human vision.
- Iteration, reflection, and ethical awareness are critical in all AI projects.
- The capstone demonstrates **practical integration of AI into personal, creative, and professional workflows**.
- Human oversight ensures AI outputs are **accurate, safe, and aligned with your goals**.

---

## **Module 8 — Summary & Outcomes**

By the end of this module, learners can:

✔ Apply AI to a meaningful, real-world project

✔ Integrate generative and agentic AI responsibly

✔ Reflect critically on AI’s role in creative and professional workflows

✔ Practice iterative collaboration and ethical decision-making

✔ Communicate results, process, and insights effectively

---

This capstone **solidifies learning from Modules 1–7**, giving learners **hands-on experience** while reinforcing responsible AI use.
