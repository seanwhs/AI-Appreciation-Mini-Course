## **Hands-On / Interactive Activities**

1. **AI Suitability Exercise**

   * List SOC/blue-team tasks
   * Apply AI suitability criteria
   * Discuss in small groups which tasks are best augmented by AI

2. **Alert Triage Demo**

   * Use SIEM/SOAR AI features to cluster, prioritize, and triage alerts
   * Review AI-generated recommendations vs. analyst decisions

3. **Incident Investigation Scenario**

   * Present a mock incident
   * Learners use AI-assisted workflows to build a timeline, enrich IOCs, and draft response notes
   * Compare results to manual investigation

4. **Detection Engineering Simulation**

   * Learners review noisy alerts
   * Use AI to generate and tune detection rules
   * Evaluate improvement in false positives / coverage

---

## **Assessment**

* Multiple-choice or scenario-based questions on AI roles, limits, and workflows
* Hands-on evaluation: perform AI-assisted triage or incident investigation
* Group discussion on ethical considerations, human-in-the-loop requirements

---

## **Materials & References**

* **Cheat Sheet:** “AI in Blue Teaming” (one-page reference)
* **Tool References:** Splunk ML Toolkit, Microsoft Sentinel AI, Cortex XSOAR, Darktrace, Vectra AI, Recorded Future AI, Wiz AI
* **Slides & Visual Aids:** Diagrams of AI workflows in SOC, playbooks, maturity model

---

## **Key Takeaways**

* AI **enhances speed, accuracy, and consistency**, but humans retain **judgment, containment authority, and strategy responsibilities**.
* Blue teams can use AI for: triage, investigation, detection engineering, IOC enrichment, cloud security, and reporting.
* Implement **guardrails, human-in-the-loop workflows, and ethical rules** to prevent misuse.
* AI transforms the SOC from **reactive to predictive**, letting analysts focus on high-value tasks.
