## **Section 3 — Short Answer (5 Questions)**

1. Name two AI tools for **alert triage and prioritization**.
   **Sample Answer:** Microsoft Sentinel AI, Splunk ML Toolkit

2. How does UEBA AI help in insider threat detection?
   **Sample Answer:** Learns normal user/device behavior, flags deviations, scores suspicious events for review

3. Give one example of AI-assisted **log analysis & event correlation**.
   **Sample Answer:** Splunk AI Assistant, Chronicle SecOps AI

4. How can AI assist in incident response?
   **Sample Answer:** Summarizes timelines, suggests next steps, gathers artifact details, references historical incidents

5. Why is IOC enrichment important in blue team operations?
   **Sample Answer:** Provides context, links IOCs to TTPs, identifies known vs. unknown threats, accelerates response

---

## **Section 4 — Application / Scenario (3 Questions)**

1. A SOC analyst receives hundreds of daily alerts, many false positives. How can AI help?
   **Sample Answer:** Deduplicate alerts, prioritize by severity, cluster similar alerts, flag anomalies for faster escalation

2. During an investigation, an analyst wants to check if an IOC is linked to known campaigns. How might AI assist?
   **Sample Answer:** Enrich the IOC with threat intelligence feeds, suggest related indicators, label known/unknown threats

3. A blue team wants to reduce misconfigurations in cloud environments. What AI function can help?
   **Sample Answer:** Analyze configurations, flag high-risk exposures, recommend baseline hardening, suggest remediation steps
