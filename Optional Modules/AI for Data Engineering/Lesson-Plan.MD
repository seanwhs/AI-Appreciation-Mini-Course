## **Lesson Outline**

### **1. Introduction — 10 minutes**

**Objective:** Set context and define AI’s role in data engineering.
**Content:**

* Overview of AI in data workflows
* Tasks AI excels at vs. human responsibilities

**Activity:**
*Quick discussion:* “Which parts of your current workflow feel repetitive or error-prone?”

**Delivery:** Presentation + Q&A

---

### **2. AI in Data Engineering — The Big Picture — 10 minutes**

**Objective:** Understand why data engineering is highly AI-ready.

**Content:**

* Pattern recognition, repetition, large datasets, rules-based logic, iterative pipelines
* AI automates: cleaning, transformation, schema inference, anomaly detection, monitoring, metadata management
* Humans handle: strategy, architecture, governance, ethical decisions, complex debugging

**Activity:** Mini poll or show-of-hands: “Which tasks in your workflows could AI handle today?”

**Delivery:** Slides + interactive discussion

---

### **3. Core AI Applications — 50 minutes**

**Objective:** Explore AI applications with real-world tools and platforms.

**Format:** 7 mini-segments (~7 minutes each)
Each segment covers: What AI does, Use cases, Real tools, Platform examples

**Segments:**

1. **Data Ingestion & Integration**
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation Automation**
3. **Schema & Metadata Management Assistance**
4. **Data Quality Monitoring & Anomaly Detection**
5. **Automated Documentation & Reporting**
6. **Learning & Data Exploration (“Data Vibe Hunting”)**
7. **Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing**

**Activity per segment:** Quick breakout discussion or live demo of AI tool features (if available).

**Delivery:** Slides + demonstrations + discussion

---

### **4. Hands-On Activity — “Where Can AI Help Your Data Engineering?” — 15–20 minutes**

**Objective:** Apply AI suitability evaluation to learners’ own workflows.

**Instructions:**

1. List 5–7 recurring tasks in your current data engineering workflows.
2. Evaluate each task against these AI suitability criteria:

* Repetitive
* Pattern-heavy
* Error-prone
* Time-consuming
* Documentation-heavy
* Alert-heavy
* Exploration/prototyping

3. Identify tasks meeting **2+ criteria** as strong AI candidates.

**Deliverable:** Completed table of tasks, criteria met, and AI potential (Low/Med/High).

**Delivery:** Individual or small-group exercise + group discussion

---

### **5. Module Summary & Key Takeaways — 10 minutes**

**Objective:** Reinforce learning and practical application.

**Content:**

* AI is already embedded in modern data platforms
* AI accelerates ingestion, transformation, cleaning, monitoring, and reporting
* Data Vibe Hunting enables interactive exploration and skill growth
* Engineers remain essential for architecture, strategy, and governance decisions
* Partnering with AI improves productivity, data quality, and analytics readiness

**Delivery:** Slide summary + Q&A

---

### **6. Cheat Sheet & Reference — 5 minutes**

**Objective:** Provide a concise resource for learners to reference post-session.

**Content:** One-page “AI in Data Engineering” cheat sheet (tasks AI excels at, when not to use AI, bottom line).

**Activity:** Share cheat sheet as PDF or printout

---

### **Optional Extension Activities**

* Live demo of AI-enhanced ETL pipelines (Fivetran, Trifacta, dbt AI plugins)
* Hands-on exploration of a sample dataset using AI tools for anomaly detection, cleaning, or visualization
* Small-group discussion: “How would you redesign one of your pipelines using AI?”

---

### **Materials Needed**

* Slide deck with visuals of AI workflows and tools
* Cheat sheet handout (PDF)
* Sample datasets for demo/exploration
* Access to AI-powered tools (optional for hands-on demos)
