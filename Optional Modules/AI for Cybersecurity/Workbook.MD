# **2. AI in Cybersecurity — The Big Picture**

Cybersecurity is AI-dependent because of:

* Massive log volumes and high event throughput
* Continuous real-time monitoring needs
* Rapidly evolving threat landscape
* Analyst fatigue and alert overload

**AI automates:** Repetitive, time-sensitive, high-volume analysis
**Humans handle:** Contextual threat interpretation, escalation judgment, critical decisions, adversary analysis, and incident strategy

**Reflection Prompt:**
✏️ Which high-volume or repetitive tasks in your security role could benefit from AI assistance?

* Generates new attack vectors
* Suggests defense strategies proactively
* Continuously evolves scenarios to match emerging adversary tactics
* Integrates with SOC dashboards and SIEM/EDR platforms

**Use Cases:**

* Run AI-generated Red Team simulations to uncover vulnerabilities
* Generate synthetic phishing campaigns, malware behavior, or network intrusions
* Identify weak configurations or policy gaps
* Provide real-time mitigation suggestions
* Map TTPs automatically to MITRE ATT&CK

**Benefits to Blue Teams:**

* Faster learning cycles
* Expanded coverage of potential attacks
* Reduced human bias
* Proactive defense implementation

**Tools / Platforms:** MITRE Caldera (AI modules), AttackIQ, Cymulate, Picus Security, ThreatQ, custom AI simulations

**Analyst Workflow Examples:**

* Generate TTP scenarios → simulate → measure detection coverage → refine rules/playbooks
* Use AI-simulated adversaries to identify gaps in detection logic
* Automate continuous Purple Team exercises
