# **AI for Traders — Enhanced Module**

## **Module Goal**

Enable traders to understand:

## **1. AI in Trading — Big Picture**

Traders handle **high-frequency, pattern-driven, and data-intensive work**. AI is well-suited because trading involves:

* Massive datasets (market data, news, sentiment)
* Pattern recognition (price trends, correlations, anomalies)
* Repetition (backtesting, report generation)
* Rules-based decision-making (risk limits, strategies)
* Iterative feedback loops (strategy refinement, portfolio adjustments)

**AI Automates:**

* Market data analysis and signal detection
* Portfolio monitoring and risk metrics
* Strategy backtesting and scenario simulations
* Drafting research reports and trade summaries
* News and sentiment filtering

**Humans Handle:**

* Strategic trade decisions and capital allocation
* Risk management and regulatory compliance
* Creative strategy design and intuition-driven trades
* Ethical and legal judgment
* Client/stakeholder relationships

AI **augments** traders; it **does not replace them**.
