* “Rewrite this paragraph for clarity.”

---

## **4. Class Activity — “Where Can AI Help You?” (10 minutes)**

Students list **5–7 tasks** in their writing workflow.
For each, they evaluate:

* Repetitive
* Time-consuming
* Information-heavy
* Creatively draining
* Administrative

Tasks with **2+ criteria** → good AI candidates.

### **Outcome:**

Students identify personalized areas where AI can immediately help.

**Goal:** Learn how to get quality ideas fast.

---

### **Exercise B — Drafting & Rewriting**

Prompt examples:

* “Take this outline and draft a 200-word scene.”
* “Rewrite this paragraph with more tension.”

**Goal:** See how AI boosts early drafting and revision speed.

---

### **Exercise C — Editing & Feedback**

Provide students with a sample paragraph (or have them use their own writing).

Prompt examples:

* “Edit for clarity and flow while keeping my tone.”
* “Provide a line-by-line critique.”

**Goal:** Understand AI’s strength in polishing text.

---

## **6. Discussion — AI Ethics, Originality & Creative Control (10 minutes)**

Topics to cover:

Choose one:

### **Option 1: AI-Assisted Drafting**

Use AI to expand an outline into a 300–500-word scene.

### **Option 2: AI Revision**

Take a rough draft and ask AI for three rewritten variations.

### **Option 3: AI Brainstorming**

Create a character profile, worldbuilding system, or plot outline with AI.

Students submit:
