| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Narrow AI           | Performs specific tasks                                            | Virtual assistants, recommendation systems |
| General AI          | Hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can | Not yet realized                           |
| Superintelligent AI | Hypothetical AI surpassing human intelligence                      | Future theoretical AI                      |

**Reflection Questions:**

1. Where do you interact with AI in your daily life?
2. How is AI different from traditional software programs?

# **2. Machine Learning (ML)**

**Definition:**
ML is a subset of AI that enables computers to **learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions** without explicit programming.

### **Types of ML:**

| Type                   | Description                            | Example                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Supervised Learning    | Learns from labeled data               | Predicting house prices |
| Unsupervised Learning  | Finds patterns in unlabeled data       | Customer segmentation   |
| Reinforcement Learning | Learns by trial and error with rewards | Game-playing AI         |

**Applications:**

* Predictive analytics (e.g., sales forecasting)
* Fraud detection
* Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)

**Exercise:** Identify an example of ML in your field or daily life.

# **3. Deep Learning (DL)**

**Definition:**
DL is a **subset of ML** that uses artificial neural networks with **multiple layers** to learn complex patterns from large amounts of data.

**Key Concepts:**

* Neural networks: neurons, layers, weights, biases, activation functions
* Types: CNNs (images), RNNs/LSTMs (sequences), Transformers (NLP)
* Training with backpropagation

**Applications:**

* Computer vision (image/video recognition)
* Natural Language Processing (chatbots, translation)
* Speech recognition and synthesis
* Autonomous vehicles

**Exercise:** Match applications with network types: CNN, RNN, Transformer.

# **4. Generative AI (GenAI)**

**Definition:**
Generative AI is a **subset of AI** that can **create new content** (text, images, music, video) based on patterns learned from existing data.

**Key Concepts:**

* Uses models like **Transformers** (for text) and **GANs** (for images)
* Can generate human-like, creative outputs

**Applications:**

* Text: GPT-3, ChatGPT for essays, stories
* Images: DALL-E, MidJourney
* Music: AIVA, OpenAI Jukedeck
* Video: Runway ML, deepfakes

**Activity:** Experiment with a Generative AI tool to create text, image, or music.

# **5. Agentic AI**

**Definition:**
Agentic AI refers to **AI systems capable of autonomous decision-making** to achieve goals in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional AI, which acts in response to prompts, **agentic AI can plan, act, and adapt independently**.

**Key Characteristics:**

* Goal-oriented behavior
* Ability to make decisions without explicit human intervention
* Adaptive learning in real time

**Applications:**

* Autonomous drones and robots
* AI assistants that perform tasks independently
* Self-driving cars

**Reflection Questions:**

1. What risks might arise with agentic AI?
2. How could agentic AI improve efficiency in your work or daily life?

# **6. Relationships Between AI Subfields**

| AI Subfield | Relationship                                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI          | Umbrella term for intelligent machines                    |
| ML          | Subset of AI, focused on learning from data               |
| DL          | Subset of ML, uses deep neural networks for complex tasks |
| GenAI       | Uses DL/ML to generate creative content                   |
| Agentic AI  | AI with autonomous, goal-directed capabilities            |

**Diagram Idea:** AI → ML → DL → GenAI; Agentic AI branching as autonomous intelligence

# **7. Hands-On Activities**

1. **ML Experiment:** Train a simple supervised learning model on a dataset (e.g., Iris or Titanic dataset).
2. **DL Experiment:** Use a pre-trained CNN to classify images.
3. **GenAI Experiment:** Generate text or images using ChatGPT or DALL-E.
4. **Agentic AI Simulation:** Explore tools like AutoGPT or BabyAGI (simulations of autonomous agents).

# **8. Ethical Considerations**

* **Bias and fairness:** Ensure models don’t reinforce societal inequalities
* **Privacy:** Protect personal data used for training
* **Autonomy and control:** Risks of agentic AI acting unpredictably
* **Misinformation:** Deepfakes and AI-generated content
* **Job impact:** Automation replacing certain roles

**Activity:** Case discussion: A bank uses AI to approve loans. Some applicants are unfairly denied due to biased data. How could this be mitigated?
