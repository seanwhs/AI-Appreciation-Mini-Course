| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Supervised Learning**    | Learns from labeled data  | Email spam detection  |
| **Unsupervised Learning**  | Finds hidden patterns     | Customer segmentation |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Learns by trial and error | Game-playing agents   |

# **SECTION 3 — DEEP LEARNING (DL)**

## **3.1 What is Deep Learning?**

Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses **neural networks with many layers** to learn complex patterns.

### **Neural Network Diagram (Simplified)**

```
Input Layer → Hidden Layer 1 → Hidden Layer 2 → Output Layer
       ● ● ●         ● ● ●           ● ● ●            ● ●
```

## **3.2 Network Types**

| Network Type                           | Best For                   | Examples             |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** | Images                     | Face recognition     |
| **RNN / LSTM**                         | Sequences                  | Language translation |
| **Transformers**                       | Long sequences + reasoning | ChatGPT, BERT        |

---

## **3.3 Activity — Match the Network**

Match the application with the correct network type.

| Application                            | CNN / RNN / Transformer |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Detecting cats in an image             | ________                |
| Predicting the next word in a sentence | ________                |
| ChatGPT generating an email            | ________                |

## **3.4 Reflection Question**

Why is Deep Learning more powerful than traditional ML?

---

---

---

# **SECTION 4 — GENERATIVE AI (GenAI)**

## **4.1 What is Generative AI?**

Generative AI creates new content—text, images, music, video—based on patterns it learned.

### **Examples:**

* ChatGPT → text
* DALL-E → images
* AIVA → music

---

## **4.2 Activity — Create With GenAI**

Choose one:
☐ Generate a short paragraph using a text generator
☐ Generate an image from a text prompt
☐ Generate a music clip

**Paste or describe your AI-generated output below:**

---

---

---

## **4.3 Quick Check**

Fill in the blanks:

Generative AI is different because it can **___________** new content instead of just predicting or classifying data.

---

# **SECTION 5 — AGENTIC AI**

## **5.1 What is Agentic AI?**

Agentic AI systems can **act autonomously**, plan, and make decisions to achieve goals.

Unlike standard AI (reacts to prompts), agentic AI can:

* set or refine goals
* choose actions
* adapt to changing environments

---

## **5.2 Examples**

✔ Self-driving vehicles
✔ AutoGPT-like autonomous agents
✔ Warehouse robots
✔ Smart drone navigation

---

## **5.3 Activity — Think Like an Agent**

Imagine you're designing an agentic AI to help someone plan travel.

**The agent must:**

1. Find flights
2. Compare prices
3. Suggest hotels
4. Create an itinerary

**What decisions must the agent make on its own?**

# **SECTION 6 — ETHICAL & SOCIETAL CONSIDERATIONS**

## **6.1 Key Concerns**

* **Bias** — unfair outcomes
* **Privacy** — sensitive data exposure
* **Safety** — misuse or accidents
* **Transparency** — the “black box” problem
* **Job Impact** — automation replacing tasks

---
