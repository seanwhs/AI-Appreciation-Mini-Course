# **AI in Project Management — The Big Picture**

Project management involves repeated tasks, pattern recognition, and large datasets. Typical areas include:

* Scheduling & resource allocation
* Task prioritization & dependencies
* Risk identification & mitigation
* Reporting & stakeholder communication
* Budget tracking & forecasting

AI excels at **repetitive, data-driven, and predictive tasks**, freeing project managers to focus on strategy, leadership, and stakeholder engagement.

---

### **AI Automates:**

* Task scheduling & resourcing
* Risk analysis & early warning detection
* Progress reporting & dashboards
* Budget monitoring & forecasting
* Meeting summaries & action item tracking

### **Humans Handle:**

* Strategic decision-making
* Stakeholder negotiations
* Conflict resolution
* Risk acceptance or mitigation strategy
* Creative problem-solving

Modern project management platforms increasingly integrate AI—either directly (predictive scheduling) or indirectly (suggestions, analysis).
