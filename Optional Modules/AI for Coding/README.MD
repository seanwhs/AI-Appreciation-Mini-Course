# **AI for Coding**

## **Goal of This Module**

Equip learners to recognize:

* **Where AI already appears in coding workflows**
* **Which tools and IDE-based AI assistants enable it**
* **What tasks AI can automate, augment, or accelerate**
* **How developers can partner with AI** to improve productivity, code quality, debugging, and innovation

---

# **AI in Coding — The Big Picture**

Programming and software development are highly AI-ready because many tasks depend on:

* Repetition
* Pattern recognition
* Rules-based logic
* Large datasets (codebases, APIs, documentation)
* Testing and debugging cycles

AI excels in these environments and dramatically accelerates development.
But **AI does not replace developers**—it shifts them from *typing and searching* to *designing, reviewing, and innovating*.

### **AI automates:**

Boilerplate, repetitive coding, documentation, refactoring, and error detection.

### **Humans handle:**

Architecture design, creative problem solving, debugging complex logic, ethical decision-making, and client requirements interpretation.

Most modern IDEs already have AI assistants embedded—even if users don’t call it “AI.”
