* **Hands-On Activities:** Learners interact with AI to autocomplete, debug, refactor, document, test, and prototype.
* **Small Group Discussion:** “Where Can AI Help You Code?” mapping exercise.
* **Reflection:** Discuss limitations and ethical considerations of AI in coding.

---

* Discussion participation in reflection and Q&A.
* Optional follow-up assignment: AI-enhanced mini-project or Vibe Coding exercise.

---

## **Key Tips for Instructors**

* Encourage learners to **think critically** about when AI is useful vs. when human judgment is required.
* Use **Vibe Coding exercises** to promote experimentation and curiosity.
* Highlight **ethical considerations**, e.g., plagiarism, code security, or over-reliance on AI.
* Keep demonstrations **live and interactive**—show trial-and-error with AI suggestions to model realistic workflows.
