# **AI for Coding — Learner Workbook**

**Goal:** Equip you to recognize AI’s role in coding workflows, identify AI tools, and understand how to partner with AI effectively.

---

## **Section 1: AI in Coding — The Big Picture**

**Reflection:**

1. List coding tasks you do that involve repetition, pattern recognition, rules-based logic, or testing/debugging cycles.

| Task | Repetitive? | Pattern-heavy? | Testing-heavy? |
| ---- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
|      |             |                |                |
|      |             |                |                |

**Prompt:**

* Which of these tasks could an AI help you do faster or more efficiently?

---

## **Section 2: Where AI Shows Up Today**

For each AI category, reflect and try the suggested hands-on exercises.

---

### **2.1 Code Autocompletion & Boilerplate Generation**

**Questions:**

1. Think of a coding task you repeatedly do (e.g., creating CRUD APIs). How could AI speed this up?
2. Which AI tool would you try first: Copilot, Ghostwriter, TabNine, IntelliCode? Why?

**Activity:**

* Use an AI assistant to generate a starter class or function in your IDE.
* Compare the generated code with your usual approach.

**Observation Notes:**

* What worked well?
* What needed manual adjustment?

---

### **2.2 Code Debugging & Error Detection**

**Reflection:**

1. Recall a recent bug or runtime error. Could AI have detected it faster?
2. What types of errors might AI struggle with?

**Activity:**

* Introduce a small bug into a code snippet.
* Use an AI tool to identify and fix the bug.

| Bug | AI-detected? | Suggested fix | Your notes |
| --- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
|     |              |               |            |

---

### **2.3 Refactoring & Code Optimization**

**Activity:**

* Take a messy or inefficient code snippet.
* Use AI to suggest refactoring or optimization.

**Reflection:**

1. Did AI improve readability or performance?
2. Were any suggestions incorrect or suboptimal?

| Before | After | Notes |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
|        |       |       |

---

### **2.4 Documentation & Comments Generation**

**Activity:**

* Pick a function or module and use AI to generate docstrings, comments, or README content.

**Reflection:**

1. Does the AI-generated documentation clearly explain the code?
2. What improvements would you make manually?

---

### **2.5 Test Case Generation & QA**

**Activity:**

* Use AI to generate unit tests for a function you wrote.
* Review and run the tests.

**Reflection:**

1. Did AI catch edge cases you might have missed?
2. Were any test cases irrelevant or redundant?

| Test Case | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
|           |           |       |

---

### **2.6 Learning & Vibe Coding**

**Concept:**
Vibe Coding is using AI to **explore, learn, and prototype interactively**.

**Activity:**

1. Choose a small project idea or library you want to learn.
2. Use AI to generate starter code, explain concepts, or experiment interactively.

**Reflection:**

* What did AI help you learn faster?
* How did it change your workflow or experimentation?

---

### **2.7 Code Review & Collaboration**

**Activity:**

* Use AI to review a teammate’s snippet or your own code for style, security, or bugs.
* Compare AI suggestions with your own review process.

| Issue | AI Suggestion | Your decision |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------- |
|       |               |               |

---

## **Section 3: Activity — “Where Can AI Help You Code?”**

**Instructions:**

1. List 5–7 recurring tasks in your coding workflow.
2. Evaluate each against these AI suitability criteria:

   * Repetitive
   * Pattern-heavy
   * Error-prone
   * Time-consuming
   * Documentation-heavy
   * Test-heavy
   * Learning/prototyping

| Task | Criteria Met | AI Potential (Low/Med/High) |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
|      |              |                             |
|      |              |                             |

**Reflection:**

* Which tasks will you start using AI for immediately?
* Which tasks are best left to human judgment?

## **Section 4: Cheat Sheet — “AI in Coding: Quick Reference”**

| Category                     | What AI Does                                                  | Tools / IDE Examples                             |

| Debugging & Error Detection  | Detects syntax/logical errors, suggests fixes                 | DeepCode, Codiga, Kite                           |
| Refactoring & Optimization   | Improves readability/performance, reduces duplicates          | JetBrains AI, Refactor.ai, Copilot               |
| Documentation                | Generates docstrings, README, API docs                        | Copilot, Docstring AI, Sphinx w/ AI              |
| Test Case Generation         | Generates unit/integration tests, suggests edge cases         | Testim AI, Diffblue Cover, Copilot               |

**When NOT to use AI:**

* Critical architecture/design decisions
* Novel or ambiguous problems
* Ethical/safety-critical tasks
* Deep human judgment required
