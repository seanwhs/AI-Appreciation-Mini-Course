# **Activity — “Where Can AI Help You Code?”**

1. **List 5–7 recurring coding tasks** (e.g., code completion, debugging, test generation).

2. **Evaluate each task using AI suitability criteria**:

   * Repetitive
   * Pattern-heavy
   * Error-prone
   * Time-consuming
   * Documentation-heavy
   * Test-heavy
   * Learning or prototyping

3. **Assess AI Potential**: Using the matrix above, assign **Low/Medium/High** AI potential to each task.

| **Task**                               | **Criteria Met**                          | **AI Potential (Low/Med/High)** |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Example Task 1: Code Debugging         | Error-prone, Time-consuming               | High                            |
| Example Task 2: Boilerplate Generation | Repetitive, Pattern-heavy                 | High                            |

# **Module Summary**

Learners will understand:

* **AI is embedded in most modern IDEs**, helping with code completion, debugging, testing, and documentation generation.
* **AI boosts productivity** by automating repetitive tasks like boilerplate generation, error detection, and refactoring, letting developers focus on high-level problem-solving and design.
* **AI accelerates learning and exploration**, offering "vibe coding" — an interactive, experimental approach to trying new libraries, frameworks, or code patterns.
* **Developers remain essential** for creativity, architecture, and ethical decision-making. AI **augments** human capabilities, improving speed and quality without replacing the need for human expertise.
* **Partnering with AI increases productivity**, leading to better collaboration, faster development cycles, and higher-quality code.
