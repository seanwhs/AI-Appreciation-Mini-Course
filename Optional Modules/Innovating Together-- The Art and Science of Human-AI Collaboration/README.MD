### **Activity: The AI Futures Map for Your Work, Life, and Play**

**Objective**: This activity helps you assess how AI can enhance **work**, **life**, and **play**, identifying key tasks where collaboration with AI will yield the greatest benefits.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **List Key Tasks and Activities**: Reflect on tasks across three domains:

   * **Work**: List 5–7 core tasks in your job or professional life (e.g., report writing, meetings, customer interactions, data analysis).
   * **Life**: Consider regular activities in your personal life (e.g., managing finances, fitness routines, household chores, personal development).
   * **Play**: Think about how you spend your leisure time (e.g., gaming, hobbies, content creation, entertainment consumption).

2. **Assess Each Task**: For each task, rate them on the following scales to determine how AI could play a role in enhancing or automating the activity:

   * **Repetition**: Is the task repetitive or variable?
   * **Predictability**: Can the task be standardized or does it require judgment?
   * **Rules-based Structure**: Is the task highly structured, or does it involve significant creative or strategic thinking?
   * **Time Volume**: How much time does this task consume daily, weekly, or monthly?
   * **Value to You**: How important is this task in terms of personal or professional impact?

3. **Categorize Tasks**: After assessing each task, categorize it into one of the following groups:

   * **Automate**: Tasks that are highly repetitive, predictable, and rules-based (e.g., scheduling, basic data entry, routine customer inquiries). These tasks are best handled by AI to free up your time for more creative or strategic pursuits.
   * **Augment**: Tasks that require human intuition or judgment but can be enhanced by AI tools (e.g., generating content ideas, analyzing data, personalizing marketing strategies). These tasks become more efficient with AI collaboration.
   * **Human-Led**: Tasks that require **creative thinking**, **empathy**, **strategic judgment**, or **emotional intelligence** (e.g., leading a team, making ethical decisions, building relationships). These are resistant to full automation but can be enhanced through AI-assisted insights.

4. **Design Your Future Role**:

   * For each category, design how AI could help **optimize** or **augment** your activities. This is about reimagining how you can integrate AI into your daily routines to enhance both your **work** and **life**.
   * Think about your **personal life** as well—how might AI enhance your hobbies, health, fitness, and leisure activities? Can AI suggest new hobbies, improve your fitness routine, or help you explore new interests?

5. **Create a Personal “AI Futures Map”**:

   * Draw or outline a vision of your future role—whether it’s a job, life, or leisure activity—where AI works alongside you to maximize your potential. This might include how AI supports your career, elevates your personal life, or even sparks creativity in your free time.
