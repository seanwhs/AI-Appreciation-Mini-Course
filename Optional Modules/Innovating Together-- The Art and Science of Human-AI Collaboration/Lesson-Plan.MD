**Key Points to Cover:**

* AI is not just about automation—it's about enhancing human abilities.
* AI is being integrated into multiple facets of life and work to optimize efficiency, creativity, and decision-making.

#### **2. AI's Role in Work, Life, and Play (30 minutes)**

**Objective:** Dive deeper into how AI is reshaping these three key areas.

* **Presentation**: Break down AI's impact across work, life, and play (Refer to detailed sections in the module)

  * **At Work**: Focus on automation (data entry, reporting) and collaboration (AI-driven insights in decision-making).
  * **In Life**: Highlight AI-powered personal assistants, wellness apps, and smart home integration.
  * **In Play**: Discuss AI’s transformative role in gaming, content recommendation systems, and creative tools for art and media.

**Activity**: Group Discussion

* Divide the class into three groups: one for work, one for life, and one for play.
* Ask each group to list AI applications and opportunities in their assigned area and discuss potential benefits or concerns.
* Each group presents their findings.

**Key Points to Cover:**

* AI's purpose is to augment, not replace, human intelligence.
* Explore current and future possibilities of AI across various domains.

#### **3. AI and the Future of Work, Life, and Play (30 minutes)**

**Objective:** Explain how AI is changing job roles and creating new opportunities across sectors and personal lives.

* **Presentation**: Discuss hybrid roles and new opportunities in work, life, and play due to AI:

  * **Work**: Automation creates new roles requiring human creativity and strategic input (e.g., Human-AI collaboration in healthcare, marketing).
  * **Life**: Personal productivity tools, AI life coaches, and wellness apps.
  * **Play**: AI as a tool for creative expression in art, music, and gaming.

**Activity**: **Brainstorm New Roles**

* Have learners identify new AI-driven roles they think might exist in the near future (e.g., AI wellness coach, AI-enhanced marketer).
* Allow students to discuss the required skill sets for these roles.

**Key Points to Cover:**

* New roles are emerging where AI supports rather than replaces human work.
* AI-powered tools open up opportunities in personal development, health, and creative fields.

#### **4. AI-Accelerated vs. AI-Resistant Tasks (30 minutes)**

**Objective:** Help learners identify which tasks are suitable for AI automation and which will remain resistant to it.

* **Presentation**: Explain the concept of AI-accelerated vs. AI-resistant tasks (Refer to section 3 of the module).

  * **AI-Accelerated Tasks**: Routine, repetitive tasks that AI can optimize or enhance (data entry, customer support).
  * **AI-Resistant Tasks**: Tasks that require human empathy, creativity, and judgment (leadership, innovation, artistic creation).

**Activity**: **Categorize Tasks**

* Ask learners to think of 3-5 tasks they perform regularly (work-related or personal).
* In pairs or small groups, discuss how these tasks could be categorized (AI-accelerated or AI-resistant).
* Each group shares their results and the class discusses.

**Key Points to Cover:**

* Tasks that require repetitive actions or data processing are most amenable to AI.
* Human-centered tasks (empathy, creativity, leadership) are resistant to full automation but can benefit from AI collaboration.
