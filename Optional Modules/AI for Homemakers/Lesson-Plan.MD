### **Lesson Breakdown:**

---

#### **1. Introduction (10 minutes)**

**Objective:**
Introduce the concept of AI in homemaking and provide context for its use in daily routines.

* **Discussion:**
  Start with a short discussion about how technology is already helping with tasks in the home (e.g., smart appliances, online shopping, etc.).
  *“What tasks do you find most time-consuming or repetitive at home?”*

* **Presentation:**
  Briefly explain the role of AI in reducing the mental load and increasing efficiency in homemaking. Discuss common household tasks where AI can be applied:

  * Meal Planning
  * Budgeting and Financial Management
  * Cleaning and Organization
  * Family Scheduling
  * Health & Wellness Tracking

* **Transition:**
  “Today, we’ll explore how AI can be used to simplify these tasks and give you back more time for family, creativity, and personal well-being.”

#### **2. AI in Homemaking Overview (15 minutes)**

**Objective:**
Walk learners through key tasks AI can help with and the tools available.

* **Presentation of Tools:**

  1. **Meal Planning & Grocery Shopping:** Yummly, Mealime, Instacart
  2. **Budgeting & Financial Management:** Mint, YNAB, PocketGuard
  3. **Home Organization & Cleaning:** Roomba, Roborock, Tody
  4. **Family Scheduling & Coordination:** Google Calendar, Cozi
  5. **Health & Wellness Tracking:** Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, Apple Health

* **Hands-on Demo (Optional):**
  If learners have devices, guide them through a brief demo of one or two tools, such as adding a family member’s schedule in Google Calendar or setting up a grocery list in Yummly.

* **Discussion:**
  “Which of these tools do you think could save you the most time or effort? Why?”

#### **3. Group Activity — Evaluating AI Suitability for Household Tasks (20 minutes)**

**Objective:**
Help learners apply AI to their specific household tasks by evaluating which tasks AI could be used for.

* **Instructions:**

  1. **Break learners into small groups** (3-4 people) or have them work individually.
  2. **Task:** Each group should choose 3-4 common household tasks (e.g., meal planning, laundry, cleaning, scheduling, budgeting) and evaluate their AI potential using these criteria:

     * **Repetitive**
     * **Time-consuming**
     * **Information-heavy**
     * **Scheduling-intensive**
     * **Physical (e.g., cleaning)**
  3. **Activity Format:**

     * List the tasks and mark each one with how much AI could assist (Low, Medium, High) based on the criteria.
     * Discuss why AI would be useful (or not) for each task.

* **Outcome:**
  Groups will have a list of tasks with a clear evaluation of how AI can improve them.

* **Debrief:**
  Invite groups to share their evaluations. Highlight any unexpected insights or suggestions for unique AI uses in homemaking.

---

#### **4. Creating a Personalized AI Strategy (10 minutes)**

**Objective:**
Guide learners in applying AI to optimize their own homemaking routines.

* **Activity:**
  Ask learners to think about their own daily or weekly homemaking routines.
  *“Which of the tasks you handle could be made easier with AI? What AI tools would you use to help you?”*

  Learners should complete the following:

  * List 2-3 tasks they want to automate or optimize with AI.
  * Write down the AI tools or platforms they would use.
  * Briefly outline how they would integrate these tools into their routines.

---

#### **5. Wrap-up & Reflection (5 minutes)**

**Objective:**
Summarize the lesson and encourage learners to start implementing AI tools in their daily lives.

* **Recap:**
  Quickly review the main points:

  * AI can reduce repetitive tasks, help organize time, and make homemaking more efficient.
  * AI tools like meal planners, budgeting apps, and smart cleaning devices can save time and mental energy.

* **Reflection:**
  Ask learners to share one thing they will start doing with AI in their home (e.g., "I’m going to use Google Calendar to sync my family’s appointments").

* **Homework (Optional):**
  Encourage learners to experiment with one AI tool for a week (e.g., use a meal planning app, automate grocery shopping, or try a budgeting tool) and share their experience in the next lesson or a follow-up discussion.

---

### **Assessment:**

* **Formative Assessment:**
  During group activities, observe how learners identify tasks that can be optimized with AI and discuss their reasoning.

* **Summative Assessment:**
  The personalized AI strategy worksheet completed at the end of the lesson can be reviewed to assess each learner’s understanding and application of AI tools in homemaking.

---

### **Materials for Learners:**

* **Handout:**
  A one-page summary of AI tools for homemakers (including names of tools like Yummly, Mint, etc. and their uses).

* **Worksheets:**
  AI Evaluation Worksheet (for group activity and personalized strategy).

---

### **Conclusion:**

This lesson provides learners with a practical understanding of how AI can transform everyday homemaking tasks. By integrating AI into their routines, homemakers can save time, reduce mental clutter, and focus more on creative and emotional tasks.
