# 📘 Module 9 — Evaluating the Costs & Benefits of AI (Approx. 60-75 mins)
---

**Goal:** Equip learners to **analyze AI adoption decisions**, weighing financial, operational, ethical, and social costs against potential benefits, and determine whether AI is **cost-justifiable** in real-world scenarios.

---

## **Slide 1 — Module Overview**

**Key Points:**

- Focus on **practical evaluation** of AI adoption in personal, team, and organizational contexts.
- Emphasizes **cost justification**: determining whether AI delivers sufficient value relative to all costs.
- Encourages **responsible adoption**, including ethics, privacy, and human oversight.

**Facilitator Notes:**

- AI is a **strategic tool**, not a guaranteed solution.
- Cost justification is both **quantitative** (financial, time savings) and **qualitative** (ethical, social, productivity).
- Encourage reflection on **direct/indirect costs** and **tangible/intangible benefits**.

---

## **Slide 2 — Understanding AI Costs**

**Key Points:**

1. **Financial Costs**
    - Software subscriptions, licenses, cloud services, hardware.
    - *Example:* $50/month × 12 months × 10 users = **$6,000/year**.
2. **Human Resources Costs**
    - Training, workflow adaptation, ongoing monitoring.
    - *Example:* 10 hrs × $50/hr = **$500 per employee**.
3. **Opportunity Costs**
    - Time diverted from other productive tasks.
4. **Social & Ethical Costs**
    - Risks of bias, privacy violations, or workforce disruption.
    - Potential reputational or compliance costs.

**Facilitator Notes:**

- Share **real-world examples of AI adoption failures** due to underestimated costs.
- Ask: “What hidden costs might your team face?”

---

## **Slide 3 — Understanding AI Benefits**

**Key Points:**

1. **Productivity Gains**
    - Faster execution of repetitive or complex tasks.
    - *Example:* 5 hrs/week saved × $50/hr × 10 employees × 50 weeks = **$125,000/year**.
2. **Decision Support**
    - Smarter, data-driven business decisions.
3. **Creativity & Innovation**
    - AI-assisted brainstorming, prototyping, or content creation.
4. **Competitive Advantage**
    - Faster delivery, improved quality, or better customer experience.

**Facilitator Notes:**

- Emphasize that **benefits often require human-AI collaboration**.
- Share examples from **business, creative, and personal workflows**.

---

## **Slide 4 — Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework**

**Instructions:**

1. Select a **specific AI tool or scenario**.
2. List **all costs** (financial, human, opportunity, ethical/social).
3. List **all benefits**, including quantitative gains and qualitative improvements.
4. **Quantify costs and benefits** wherever possible.
5. Calculate **Net Benefit**:

[

\text{Net Benefit} = \text{Total Benefits} - \text{Total Costs}

]

1. Decide whether AI adoption is **cost-justifiable**.

**Facilitator Notes:**

- Provide a **matrix template**: Costs vs. Benefits, with **quantitative and qualitative columns**.
- Encourage discussion: “At what point does AI provide sufficient ROI?”

---

## **Slide 5 — Example Calculation: Cost Justification**

**Scenario:** Automating weekly marketing reports

| Costs | Amount ($) |
| --- | --- |
| AI tool subscription | 1,200 |
| Employee training | 250 |
| Integration time | 500 |
| **Total Costs** | **1,950** |

| Benefits | Amount ($) |
| --- | --- |
| Time saved (4 hrs/week × $50 × 50 weeks) | 10,000 |
| Improved accuracy & insights | Qualitative |
| **Total Quantitative Benefits** | **10,000** |

**Net Benefit:** $10,000 – $1,950 = **$8,050 → Cost-Justifiable ✅**

**Facilitator Notes:**

- Highlight: even considering intangible benefits, AI adoption is justified if quantified savings outweigh costs.
- Encourage learners to **adjust assumptions** (hourly rates, time saved, subscription costs).

---

## **Slide 6 — Hands-On Analysis (30–40 min)**

**Instructions:**

1. **Select Scenario** (10 min) – personal, professional, or community AI use.
2. **Identify Costs & Benefits** (15–20 min) – use matrix, include **quantitative and qualitative factors**.
3. **Calculate Net Benefit** (5–10 min) – determine adoption viability.

**Facilitator Notes:**

- Consider multiple stakeholders (team, organization, customers).
- Highlight ethical, privacy, and social considerations even if adoption is financially justified.

---

## **Slide 7 — Reflection & Discussion**

**Reflection Questions:**

- Which costs were most surprising or underestimated?
- Did benefits justify adoption? Why or why not?
- How did ethics, privacy, or human oversight affect your decision?
- How would changing assumptions (subscription cost, time saved) alter cost justification?

**Facilitator Notes:**

- Promote small-group discussion.
- Emphasize that cost-benefit analysis is **iterative** and context-sensitive.

---

## **Slide 8 — Optional Showcase**

- Present **AI cost-benefit analysis** (3–5 min).
- Focus on decision rationale, assumptions, and lessons learned.
- Peer questions:
    - “Would you adopt AI in this scenario?”
    - “Which assumptions were critical to your conclusion?”

---

## **Slide 9 — Key Takeaways**

- AI adoption is **not always cost-justifiable**; context matters.
- Evaluate **financial, operational, ethical, and social factors**.
- Cost justification combines **quantitative calculations** and **qualitative judgment**.
- Responsible adoption requires **human oversight, ethics, and iterative evaluation**.
- Reinforces **structured decision-making and critical thinking** skills.

---

## **Slide 10 — Summary & Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this module, learners can:

✔ Conduct **structured cost-benefit analyses**, including net benefit calculations

✔ Identify **hidden costs and overlooked benefits**

✔ Integrate **ethical, privacy, and human oversight considerations**
