## **Lesson Outline**

### **1. Module Introduction (10 minutes)**

#### **Objective:** Introduce the concept of evaluating AI adoption by focusing on cost justification.

* **Key Points:**

  * **AI as a strategic tool**: AI adoption must be carefully considered based on both tangible and intangible factors.
  * **Cost justification**: Evaluate whether AI brings sufficient value relative to all costs (financial, operational, ethical).
  * **Encourage responsible adoption**: Consider privacy, human oversight, and ethics in decision-making.

* **Facilitator Notes:**

  * Explain that AI is not always a guaranteed solution; its value depends on the context and proper implementation.
  * Emphasize that both **quantitative** (financial, time savings) and **qualitative** (ethical, social, productivity) factors are involved in cost-benefit analysis.

---

### **2. Understanding AI Costs (15 minutes)**

#### **Objective:** Break down the various costs associated with AI adoption.

* **Key Points:**

  * **Financial Costs**: Software subscriptions, licenses, cloud services, hardware, etc.
  * **Human Resources Costs**: Training, workflow adaptation, and ongoing monitoring.
  * **Opportunity Costs**: Time diverted from other productive tasks or projects.
  * **Social & Ethical Costs**: Risks such as bias, privacy violations, or potential job displacement.

* **Facilitator Notes:**

  * Use **real-world examples of AI adoption failures** where costs were underestimated (e.g., AI-based hiring tools that perpetuated biases).
  * Ask learners: “What hidden costs might your team face when adopting AI?”

---

### **3. Understanding AI Benefits (15 minutes)**

#### **Objective:** Outline the benefits AI can offer across various domains, emphasizing both tangible and intangible benefits.

* **Key Points:**

  * **Productivity Gains**: AI can automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
  * **Decision Support**: AI can help businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.
  * **Creativity & Innovation**: AI can assist in brainstorming, prototyping, and content creation.
  * **Competitive Advantage**: AI can lead to faster delivery, higher quality, or improved customer experience.

* **Facilitator Notes:**

  * Stress that many of AI's benefits require **collaboration between humans and AI**. AI should augment human creativity, not replace it.
  * Provide examples from different sectors (e.g., AI-assisted design, AI-driven customer service).

---

### **4. Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework (10 minutes)**

#### **Objective:** Introduce a structured framework to assess whether AI adoption is cost-justifiable.

* **Instructions:**

  1. Select a **specific AI tool or scenario** (e.g., automating weekly marketing reports).
  2. **List all costs**: Include financial, human, opportunity, and social/ethical costs.
  3. **List all benefits**: Quantify as many benefits as possible (e.g., time saved, revenue increase) and note qualitative benefits (e.g., creativity, decision support).
  4. **Calculate Net Benefit**: Subtract the total costs from the total benefits.
  5. **Decision**: Is the AI adoption cost-justifiable?

* **Facilitator Notes:**

  * Provide a **matrix template** for learners to list costs and benefits.
  * Encourage reflection: “At what point does AI deliver a positive return on investment (ROI)?”

---

### **5. Example Calculation: Cost Justification (10 minutes)**

#### **Objective:** Walk through a detailed example calculation of AI cost justification.

* **Scenario**: Automating weekly marketing reports

  * **Costs**:

    * AI Tool Subscription: $1,200/year
    * Employee Training: $250
    * Integration Time: $500
  * **Benefits**:

    * Time saved (4 hrs/week × $50 × 50 weeks = $10,000/year)
    * Improved accuracy and insights (qualitative)
  * **Net Benefit**:

    * $10,000 (Benefits) - $1,950 (Costs) = $8,050 → **Cost-Justifiable ✅**

* **Facilitator Notes:**

  * Emphasize that even intangible benefits (e.g., improved accuracy) can justify AI adoption.
  * Discuss how assumptions (e.g., time saved, subscription costs) might change the net benefit.

---

### **6. Hands-On Analysis (30–40 minutes)**

#### **Objective:** Provide learners with the opportunity to apply the cost-benefit analysis framework to their own scenarios.

* **Instructions**:

  1. **Select Scenario** (10 minutes): Choose a personal, professional, or community-based AI use case (e.g., automating inventory management, personal virtual assistants).
  2. **Identify Costs & Benefits** (15–20 minutes): Use the provided matrix to identify both **quantitative** and **qualitative** factors.
  3. **Calculate Net Benefit** (5–10 minutes): Determine whether AI adoption is cost-justifiable.

* **Facilitator Notes**:

  * Remind learners to consider **multiple stakeholders** (team, organization, customers).
  * Encourage participants to discuss **ethical, privacy, and social considerations** even if adoption seems financially justified.

---

### **7. Reflection & Discussion (10 minutes)**

#### **Objective:** Engage learners in a group discussion to reflect on their analysis.

* **Reflection Questions**:

  * Which costs were most surprising or underestimated?
  * Did the benefits justify adoption? Why or why not?
  * How did ethical, privacy, or human oversight affect your decision?
  * How would changing assumptions (subscription cost, time saved) alter cost justification?

* **Facilitator Notes**:

  * Facilitate **small-group discussions** to promote interaction and reflection.
  * Reinforce that **cost-benefit analysis is iterative**—as new data becomes available or assumptions change, the decision may shift.

---

### **8. Optional Showcase (10 minutes)**

#### **Objective:** Allow participants to present their findings and receive feedback.

* **Instructions**:

  * **Present your analysis**: Share the AI cost-benefit analysis for your chosen scenario (3-5 minutes).
  * Focus on decision rationale, assumptions, and lessons learned.
  * Encourage **peer feedback**:

    * “Would you adopt AI in this scenario?”
    * “Which assumptions were critical to your conclusion?”

---

### **9. Key Takeaways (5 minutes)**

#### **Objective:** Recap key concepts and ensure learners are prepared to apply them.

* **Key Takeaways**:

  * AI adoption is **not always cost-justifiable**; context matters.
  * Evaluate both **quantitative and qualitative** factors (financial, operational, social, ethical).
  * Responsible adoption requires **human oversight** and continuous evaluation.
  * **Structured decision-making** helps identify hidden costs and overlooked benefits.

---
