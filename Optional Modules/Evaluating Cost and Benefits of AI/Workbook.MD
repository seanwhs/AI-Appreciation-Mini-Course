## **2. Understanding AI Costs**

**Types of Costs:**

| Cost Type        | Examples                                                                 | Notes                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Financial        | Software subscriptions, licenses, cloud, hardware                        | e.g., $50/month × 12 months × 10 users = $6,000/year |
| Human Resources  | Training, workflow adaptation, ongoing monitoring                        | e.g., 10 hrs × $50/hr = $500 per employee            |
| Opportunity      | Time diverted from other tasks                                           | Often overlooked                                     |
| Social & Ethical | Bias, privacy risks, workforce disruption, reputational/compliance costs | Qualitative, but can have financial impact           |

**Facilitator Tip:** Share **real-world AI adoption failures** caused by underestimated costs.

## **3. Understanding AI Benefits**

**Types of Benefits:**

| Benefit Type            | Examples                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Productivity            | Faster execution of repetitive/complex tasks, e.g., 5 hrs/week × $50 × 10 employees × 50 weeks = $125,000/year |
| Decision Support        | Smarter, data-driven decisions                                                                                 |
| Creativity & Innovation | AI-assisted brainstorming, prototyping, content creation                                                       |
| Competitive Advantage   | Faster delivery, improved quality, better customer experience                                                  |

**Facilitator Tip:** Emphasize that **benefits require human-AI collaboration**.

## **4. Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework**

**Step-by-Step:**

1. Select a **specific AI tool or scenario**
2. List **all costs** (financial, human, opportunity, ethical/social)
3. List **all benefits** (quantitative and qualitative)
4. **Quantify** costs and benefits wherever possible
5. Calculate **Net Benefit**:

[
\text{Net Benefit} = \text{Total Benefits} - \text{Total Costs}
]

6. Decide if AI adoption is **cost-justifiable**

**Facilitator Tip:** Use a matrix template with **quantitative and qualitative columns** for discussion.

## **5. Example Calculation**

**Scenario:** Automating weekly marketing reports

| Costs                | Amount ($) |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| AI tool subscription | 1,200      |
| Employee training    | 250        |
| Integration time     | 500        |
| **Total Costs**      | **1,950**  |

| Benefits                                 | Amount ($)  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Time saved (4 hrs/week × $50 × 50 weeks) | 10,000      |
| Improved accuracy & insights             | Qualitative |
| **Total Quantitative Benefits**          | 10,000      |

**Net Benefit:** 10,000 – 1,950 = **$8,050 → Cost-Justifiable ✅**

**Tip:** Adjust assumptions (hourly rates, time saved, subscription costs) to explore sensitivity.

## **6. Hands-On Exercise (30–40 min)**

1. **Select Scenario** (personal, professional, or community AI use) – 10 min
2. **Identify Costs & Benefits** (quantitative & qualitative) – 15–20 min
3. **Calculate Net Benefit & Decide** – 5–10 min

**Facilitator Notes:**

* Consider multiple stakeholders (team, organization, customers)
* Highlight ethical, privacy, and social considerations even if adoption is financially justified

---

## **7. Reflection & Discussion**

**Questions:**

* Which costs were surprising or underestimated?
* Did benefits justify adoption? Why or why not?
* How did ethics, privacy, or human oversight influence your decision?
* Would changing assumptions (subscription cost, time saved) alter your conclusion?

**Optional:** Showcase findings in small groups (3–5 min each).
