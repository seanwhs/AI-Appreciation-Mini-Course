---

### **Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

1. Recognize AI tools embedded in popular accounting software.
2. Understand the specific tasks AI excels at within accounting (e.g., data entry, reconciliation, fraud detection).
3. Use spreadsheet-based AI tools like Excel Copilot, GPT for Sheets, and Sheets Duet AI to automate and streamline accounting workflows.
4. Develop strategies to integrate AI into daily accounting practices to improve accuracy, speed, and insights.

---

### **Materials Needed:**

* Computers or tablets with Excel/Google Sheets installed (for AI demonstration).
* Pre-made accounting data sets (provided in the case studies section).
* Projector or screen for demonstration.
* Handouts of the AI for Accounting Cheat Sheet (quick reference).
* Whiteboard/markers for group brainstorming.

### **Module Breakdown:**

#### **1. Introduction to AI in Accounting (30 minutes)**

**Objective:** Provide learners with an overview of AI’s role in accounting.

1. **What is AI in Accounting?**

   * Discuss how AI fits into accounting workflows and improves efficiency.
   * AI excels at repetitive, rule-based tasks, and works with large datasets, such as invoices, payments, and transactions.

2. **AI vs. Humans in Accounting:**

   * Clarify that AI **automates** tasks like categorization, reconciliation, and forecasting, but humans still handle **judgment**, **client communication**, and **strategic decision-making**.

3. **AI Applications in Accounting:**

   * **Data Entry & Document Processing** (e.g., OCR for invoices).
   * **Bank Feeds & Reconciliation** (e.g., matching transactions automatically).
   * **Accounts Payable & Receivable** (e.g., detecting duplicates, automating reminders).
   * **Fraud Detection & Risk Monitoring** (e.g., spotting anomalies).
   * **Tax Preparation & Compliance** (e.g., applying updated tax rules).
   * **Forecasting & Reporting** (e.g., predicting cash flow, building financial models).

   **Key Concept:** AI is already embedded in most modern accounting software, even if users don't explicitly recognize it as AI.

#### **2. Hands-on Demonstration with AI Tools (45 minutes)**

**Objective:** Show how AI tools can be used to enhance accounting workflows with real-world examples.

1. **Automated Data Entry & Document Processing (15 minutes):**

   * **Demo:** Use Excel’s “Insert Data from Picture” or QuickBooks OCR to demonstrate how AI extracts information from invoices or receipts and populates spreadsheets.
   * **Activity:** Have participants take a photo of a sample invoice and use the AI tool to extract data automatically.

2. **Bank Feeds & Reconciliation (15 minutes):**

   * **Demo:** Show QuickBooks Smart Matching or Google Sheets’ Duet AI reconciliation checks.
   * **Activity:** Participants will use a sample bank feed to match transactions, flag anomalies, and suggest corrections.

3. **Forecasting & Financial Analysis (15 minutes):**

   * **Demo:** Use Excel Copilot for creating automatic forecasts, variance analysis, and scenario modeling.
   * **Activity:** Have participants input financial data to generate rolling cash flow forecasts using AI-powered tools.

---

#### **3. Case Studies and Application (45 minutes)**

**Objective:** Provide learners with real-life scenarios to practice using AI tools for accounting tasks.

**Activity 1: AP Cleanup & Anomaly Detection (15 minutes)**

* **Scenario:** Participants work through an accounts payable (AP) dataset where they will use AI to detect duplicate invoices, flag unusual increases in vendor spend, and suggest GL code corrections.
* **Tools:** Excel Copilot, GPT for Sheets.

**Activity 2: AR Collections Forecasting (15 minutes)**

* **Scenario:** Using a sample accounts receivable (AR) dataset, participants will use AI to forecast collections, identify high-risk customers, and recommend actions to improve cash flow.
* **Tools:** Excel Copilot, Duet AI.

**Activity 3: Fraud Detection & Risk Monitoring (15 minutes)**

* **Scenario:** Participants review journal entries in Excel and use AI to detect outliers, potential fraud indicators, and high-risk transactions.
* **Tools:** Excel Copilot, SheetAI.

---

#### **4. Group Activity: “Where Can AI Help You?” (30 minutes)**

**Objective:** Help learners identify repetitive tasks in their own workflows that AI could automate.

1. **Activity Setup:**

   * Have each learner list 5-7 recurring tasks from their accounting workflow.
   * Evaluate each task against AI suitability criteria:

     * Repetitive
     * Rules-based
     * High-volume
     * Error-prone
     * Time-consuming
     * Document-heavy
     * Spreadsheet-heavy

2. **Group Discussion:**

   * In small groups, share and discuss the tasks. Identify which tasks meet **2+ criteria** for AI automation.
   * Discuss how AI can improve the accuracy and efficiency of these tasks.

---

#### **5. Wrap-up and Reflection (15 minutes)**

**Objective:** Consolidate key takeaways and ensure understanding of AI’s role in accounting.

1. **Review Key Points:**

   * AI automates repetitive, rules-based tasks, enabling accountants to focus on strategy and client-facing work.
   * Spreadsheet AI tools bring automation into familiar tools like Excel and Google Sheets.
   * AI is not here to replace accountants; it is here to enhance their work and increase value.

2. **Q&A Session:**
   Open the floor for any questions or challenges learners may have about integrating AI into their workflows.

3. **Final Thoughts:**
   Encourage participants to experiment with the tools presented and consider which aspects of their work could benefit from AI automation.
