# **AI in Accounting — The Big Picture**

Accounting is one of the most AI-ready professions because so much of the work depends on:

* Repetition
* Large structured datasets
* Rules-based categorization
* Pattern recognition
* High-volume accuracy requirements
* Document and transaction validation

AI excels in these environments and dramatically reduces manual workload.
But **AI does not replace accountants**—it shifts them from *data processors* to *analysts, interpreters, and advisors*.

### **AI automates:**

Repetitive, rule-heavy, error-prone tasks.

### **Humans handle:**

Judgment, ethical decisions, context, client communication, business strategy, and interpretation.

Most accounting software already contains quiet, embedded AI—even if users don’t call it “AI.”
