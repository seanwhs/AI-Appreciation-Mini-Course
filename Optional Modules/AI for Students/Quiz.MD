## **Activity — “AI Task Suitability Matrix”**

1. List 5–7 recurring student tasks (e.g., note-taking, coding exercises, essay writing).
2. Evaluate them using AI suitability criteria:

* Repetitive
* Pattern-heavy
* Error-prone
* Time-consuming
* Documentation-heavy
* Analysis/interpretation-heavy

Tasks meeting **2+ criteria** are strong AI candidates.

| Task | Criteria Met | AI Potential (Low/Med/High) |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
|      |              |                             |
