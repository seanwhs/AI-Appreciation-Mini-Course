## **Section 1 — Understanding AI in Student Life**

**Activity 1 — Self-Reflection**

Answer these questions:

1. Which tasks in your student life feel repetitive or time-consuming?

3. Which tasks involve rules, patterns, or structured formatting (e.g., citations, problem sets)?
4. Which tasks require creativity or critical thinking that only you can do?

**Reflection Space:**

| Task | Type (Repetitive/Pattern/Creative/etc.) | Current Time Spent | Thoughts on AI Assistance |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
|      |                                         |                    |                           |
