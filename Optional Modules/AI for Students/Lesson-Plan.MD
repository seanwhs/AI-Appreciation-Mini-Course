| Time        | Segment                                 | Activities & Methods                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0–10 min    | **Introduction & Big Picture**          | - Discuss why AI is relevant for students.<br>- Highlight AI’s role in repetitive, pattern-based, and research-intensive tasks.<br>- Key discussion: AI augments, not replaces, students.                                                     |
| 10–25 min   | **AI in Note-Taking & Summarization**   | - Demonstrate summarizing a lecture or article using AI (e.g., ChatGPT or Notion AI).<br>- Activity: Students summarize a short reading in 1 minute using AI and manually. Compare efficiency.                                                |
| 25–40 min   | **AI in Research & Literature Review**  | - Show AI-assisted research platforms (Elicit, Zotero AI).<br>- Activity: Students search for articles on a topic and use AI to extract 3 key points each.                                                                                    |
| 40–55 min   | **Writing & Editing Assistance**        | - Demonstrate Grammarly, Word Copilot, and ChatGPT for essay drafting.<br>- Activity: Students edit a short paragraph using AI suggestions.                                                                                                   |
| 55–70 min   | **Problem Solving & STEM Practice**     | - Demonstrate solving equations or coding tasks with Wolfram Alpha / Python + Copilot.<br>- Activity: Students solve one problem manually and then check with AI, comparing reasoning steps.                                                  |
| 70–85 min   | **Time Management & Study Planning**    | - Demonstrate AI-generated study schedules (Notion AI, MyStudyLife).<br>- Activity: Students create a 3-day exam prep plan for themselves using AI.                                                                                           |
| 85–100 min  | **Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing**   | - Show AI-assisted note sharing in Teams/Docs.<br>- Activity: Students create a collaborative study note from a group discussion using AI summaries.                                                                                          |
| 100–115 min | **Activity — “Where Can AI Help You?”** | - Students list recurring tasks and evaluate AI potential using criteria:<br>Repetitive, Pattern-heavy, Error-prone, Time-consuming, Documentation-heavy, Analysis-heavy.<br>- Group discussion: Identify top 2–3 tasks to prioritize AI use. |
| 115–120 min | **Wrap-Up & Reflection**                | - Recap module objectives.<br>- Discuss ethical use of AI, academic integrity, and when human judgment is critical.<br>- Assign optional case study practice for homework.                                                                    |
