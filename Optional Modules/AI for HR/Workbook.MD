### **2. Core HR Functions and AI**

#### **A. Talent Acquisition & Recruitment (15 minutes)**

**Objective:** Learn how AI is enhancing the recruitment process by automating tasks like resume screening, candidate matching, and interview scheduling.

**What AI Does:**

* Automates resume parsing and candidate shortlisting (e.g., HireVue, X0PA AI).
* Matches job descriptions to candidate profiles using machine learning (ML) algorithms.
* Provides interview scheduling and predictive hiring models.

**Activity 1 - Case Study: Resume Screening**
Imagine you're reviewing resumes for a marketing position in your company.

* Use the AI criteria below to evaluate resumes:

| Criteria                   | High Priority | Medium Priority | Low Priority |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Skills                     |               |                 |              |
| Experience                 |               |                 |              |
| Keywords (e.g., Marketing) |               |                 |              |
| Education                  |               |                 |              |

**Task:**

* Sort 3 candidate resumes (hypothetical or real examples) using the above criteria. How would AI assist in improving the speed and accuracy of the selection process?

---

#### **B. Employee Engagement & Experience (15 minutes)**

**Objective:** Understand how AI helps to measure and improve employee engagement, track satisfaction, and predict employee retention.

**What AI Does:**

* Sentiment analysis on employee surveys and feedback.
* Predicts potential employee disengagement or turnover using historical data.
* Customizes engagement strategies based on employee preferences.

**Activity 2 - Sentiment Analysis Example**
Read through the following employee feedback (hypothetical or anonymized real feedback).

* Identify positive and negative sentiments.
* How can AI-driven sentiment analysis improve your response?

**Employee Feedback Sample:**
"Working at the company is a great experience, but I feel there is limited growth potential. I often feel my efforts go unnoticed."
**Positive Sentiments:**
**Negative Sentiments:**

Use a performance management tool that integrates AI (like **15Five** or **Lattice**). If you don't have access to these platforms, imagine you’re tracking employee KPIs in the following table:

| Employee | KPI 1 (Sales) | KPI 2 (Teamwork) | KPI 3 (Customer Satisfaction) | Feedback |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| John     | 95%           | 85%              | 90%                           |          |
| Sarah    | 60%           | 70%              | 80%                           |          |
| Bob      | 70%           | 75%              | 88%                           |          |

**Task:**

| Employee | Department | Tenure (Years) | Job Satisfaction | Performance Score | Predicted Risk of Leaving |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| John     | Marketing  | 3              | High             | 80                | Low                       |
| Sarah    | HR         | 1              | Low              | 70                | High                      |
