## **Key Trainer Tips**

1. **Validate content:** Always check AI outputs for accuracy and bias.
2. **Customize:** Adapt examples to your audience’s context.
3. **Engage:** Turn AI outputs into interactive activities rather than static content.
4. **Iterate:** Use AI iteratively—draft → review → refine → deliver.
5. **Document prompts:** Keep a library of successful AI prompts for future sessions.
