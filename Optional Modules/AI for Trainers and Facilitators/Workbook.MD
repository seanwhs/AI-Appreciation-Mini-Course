**Activity 2.2 — Validate AI Output**

After generating content with AI, complete this table:

| AI Output Section | Is Content Accurate? (Y/N) | Comments / Corrections Needed | Customization Ideas |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Objectives        |                            |                               |                     |
