## **Lesson Plan: AI for Pair Coding**

### **Objective:**

By the end of this lesson, learners will understand how to integrate AI tools into pair programming, leveraging IDE extensions (like **VSCode**) to enhance collaboration, improve productivity, and maintain high-quality code.

### **Duration:**

90 minutes

---

### **Materials Needed:**

* Computers with **VSCode** installed
* **GitHub Copilot** or other AI extensions installed (e.g., **TabNine**, **IntelliCode**)
* Sample codebases or practice problems for pair programming exercises
* Projector and screen for demonstrations
* Whiteboard or digital collaborative space for brainstorming
* Handouts (One-Page Cheat Sheet: AI for Pair Coding)

---

### **Lesson Structure:**

### **1. Introduction to Pair Programming and AI in Development (15 minutes)**

**Objective:**
Introduce the concept of pair programming and how AI can assist developers in this process.

* **Definition of Pair Programming**: Explain the collaborative practice of pair programming, where two developers work together: one writes code, while the other reviews, suggests, and provides feedback.
* **AI in Pair Programming**: Discuss the role of AI in pair programming. Emphasize that AI doesn’t replace developers but supports them in **automating repetitive tasks**, **offering real-time feedback**, and **enhancing collaboration**.

**Key Points:**

* AI tools available in IDEs like **VSCode** (GitHub Copilot, TabNine, IntelliCode)
* AI helps with code completions, debugging, refactoring, documentation, and generating test cases
* AI assists during real-time collaboration by offering code suggestions, tracking changes, and providing feedback on code quality

**Discussion Question:**

* **"How do you think AI could make pair programming more efficient?"**

### **2. Demonstrating AI Tools in VSCode (20 minutes)**

**Objective:**
Familiarize learners with AI-powered VSCode extensions and show how these tools support pair coding tasks.

* **Walkthrough of VSCode Extensions**: Demonstrate how to install and use key AI extensions, including:

  * **GitHub Copilot**: Real-time code suggestions, error detection, and documentation generation.
  * **TabNine**: AI-assisted code completion based on context.
  * **Prettier**: Auto-formatting to maintain consistent code style.
  * **ESLint**: Provides instant feedback on code style and quality issues.
  * **Live Share**: Enables real-time collaboration between developers.

**Interactive Demo**:

* Open a project in **VSCode**.
* Show **GitHub Copilot** generating code completions (e.g., auto-completing a function to fetch data from an API).
* Demonstrate how **TabNine** suggests completions and improves coding speed.
* Use **Live Share** to show how a pair can work together, with one writing code and the other offering real-time feedback, both assisted by AI-powered tools.
* Highlight **Prettier** and **ESLint** automatically formatting and linting code as it's written.

### **3. Pair Coding Activity with AI Support (30 minutes)**

**Objective:**
Allow learners to practice pair programming with AI tools and experience how AI supports the process.

**Instructions:**

* **Divide the class into pairs**: Each pair will collaborate on a coding task using AI-powered tools in **VSCode**.
* **Task**: Provide a simple coding problem or project, such as building a small API or a feature within an existing project.
* **Pair Programming Guidelines**:

  * One developer **codes**, while the other **reviews** and **offers suggestions**.
  * **AI tools** (e.g., GitHub Copilot, TabNine) will assist both partners during the session.

**Examples of Tasks:**

* Write a function to fetch and display data from an API.
* Refactor a legacy function to improve readability and performance.
* Add unit tests for existing functions.
* Implement input validation and error handling in an API endpoint.

**AI Support:**

* AI tools suggest code completions, generate unit tests, provide real-time error feedback, and recommend refactoring.

**Check-in During Activity:**

* Monitor the pairs and offer assistance, ensuring they are using AI tools effectively and collaborating as a team.

### **4. Group Reflection and Discussion (15 minutes)**

**Objective:**
Encourage learners to reflect on their experience using AI in pair programming and discuss the impact on collaboration and productivity.

**Questions for Group Discussion:**

* **"How did the AI tools help you during the pair programming session?"**
* **"Did you find that AI suggestions improved your code quality? In what ways?"**
* **"Was there anything that AI suggested that you would not have considered?"**
* **"Were there any challenges or limitations in using AI in pair programming?"**
* **"How did the real-time collaboration feel with AI assistance?"**

**Possible Answers:**

* Increased productivity through faster code completion and reduced errors
* Helpful in generating repetitive code patterns (CRUD operations, boilerplate)
* Gained confidence in debugging and understanding new code
* Some AI suggestions were less accurate or needed modification based on the specific use case

**Wrap-Up**:

* Summarize the benefits of using AI in pair programming.
* Encourage learners to experiment with AI tools in future pair programming sessions.

### **5. Closing Activity: AI in Pair Coding Cheatsheet (10 minutes)**

**Objective:**
Give learners a quick, easy-to-reference guide on how AI enhances pair programming and when to use AI tools.

**Activity:**

* Distribute the **One-Page Cheat Sheet** (AI for Pair Coding).
* Walk learners through the cheat sheet:

  * Key areas where AI excels (code completion, error detection, documentation generation)
  * Examples of **VSCode extensions** for pair programming
  * When **not** to use AI in pair coding (complex architecture decisions, ethical judgment)

**Final Question:**

* **"What will you take away from this lesson that will make your future pair programming sessions more efficient?"**

---

### **Homework/Follow-up Activity:**

**Objective:**
Provide additional practice with AI in pair programming.

**Task:**

* **Individually** or in pairs, write a small project (e.g., a to-do list app or API) using **VSCode** and integrate **AI tools** like GitHub Copilot, TabNine, and ESLint.
* Focus on:

  * Leveraging AI for **documentation generation**
  * Using **AI for refactoring** and improving code structure
  * Writing **unit tests** for the project using AI-powered tools

---

### **Assessment:**

* **Observation**: Monitor learners during the pair coding session and assess their use of AI tools.
* **Group Discussion**: Evaluate learners’ understanding of how AI supports collaboration and problem-solving.
* **Follow-up Activity**: Review the projects or tasks completed with AI assistance to gauge learners’ ability to integrate AI into pair programming.
