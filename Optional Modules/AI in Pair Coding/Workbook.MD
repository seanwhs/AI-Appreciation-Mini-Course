**3.1 Task: Create a To-Do List App with API Integration**

**Objective**: Use AI tools to collaboratively build a to-do list app with the following features:

* **Add tasks** via a form
* **Display tasks** fetched from an API
* **Edit and delete tasks** from the list

**Instructions**:

* Use **GitHub Copilot** to **suggest code completions** and **write functions** (e.g., to fetch tasks, add tasks, etc.).
* Use **TabNine** to complete repetitive parts of the code, such as creating the form inputs or rendering tasks.
* Use **ESLint** to ensure the code follows best practices and is error-free.
* Use **Prettier** to format your code and ensure consistency.
* Collaborate using **Live Share** to ensure both team members are contributing and reviewing code in real-time.

**Activity Instructions**:

* **Step 1**: **Create the HTML/CSS** for the form and list layout.
* **Step 2**: **Write the functions** to fetch tasks and display them on the page, using **GitHub Copilot** for suggestions.
* **Step 3**: **Test the app**: Use **TabNine** to generate error-free handling of edge cases.
* **Step 4**: **Collaborate** using **Live Share** for peer review, real-time updates, and to ensure proper collaboration.
