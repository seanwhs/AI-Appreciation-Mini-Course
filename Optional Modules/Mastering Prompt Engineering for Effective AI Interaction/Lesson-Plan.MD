#### **Section 1: Understanding the Basics of Prompt Engineering (25 minutes)**

1. **Core Principles of Prompt Engineering (15 minutes)**

   * **Context:** Explain the importance of providing sufficient background and context.
   * **Clarity:** Emphasize the need for clear, specific prompts to avoid ambiguity.
   * **Structure:** Discuss the value of giving structured instructions (e.g., asking for bullet points, a summary, etc.).
   * **Task-Specific Queries:** Show the difference between open-ended, specific, and role-play-based prompts.
2. **Types of Prompts & Their Use Cases (10 minutes)**

   * **Open-Ended Prompts:** When to use them for creative or general queries.
   * **Specific Prompts:** How to narrow down the scope for more accurate responses.
   * **Role-Play Prompts:** How assigning roles to the AI can enhance the relevance and focus of its responses.
   * **Instructional Prompts:** When you need a structured or detailed output.
   * **Comparative Prompts:** Use cases for asking the AI to compare and contrast ideas or concepts.

#### **Section 2: Techniques for Effective Prompt Engineering (30 minutes)**

1. **Iterative Prompt Refining (10 minutes)**

   * Introduce the **iterative process** of refining prompts.
   * Show how **small adjustments** to the wording, structure, or scope of a prompt can improve results.
   * Example: Start with a broad question, refine it into a more specific request based on the AI's response.

2. **Chain of Thought Prompting (10 minutes)**

   * Explain the technique of guiding AI through a **step-by-step reasoning process**.
   * Show how this method is especially useful for tasks that require logic, analysis, or complex solutions.
   * Example: “Explain how AI works, starting with basic concepts and then advancing to how it can be applied in specific industries like healthcare.”

3. **Advanced Techniques: Few-Shot Prompting (10 minutes)**

   * Introduce the concept of **few-shot prompting** where you provide examples for the AI to follow.
   * Discuss when and why few-shot prompting is particularly useful for tasks requiring a structured format or specialized knowledge.
   * Example: Provide two examples of formal emails and then ask the AI to write a third.

#### **Activity 1: Hands-On Practice (30 minutes)**

**Prompt Crafting Exercise (20 minutes):**

* Break students into pairs or small groups.
* Provide a general topic or task (e.g., "Generate a product description for a new fitness app").
* Ask each group to create a prompt, first in its most basic form, and then iterate to refine it using the techniques discussed.
* Groups present their prompts and AI outputs to the class, explaining the changes they made and why.

**Reflection and Peer Feedback (10 minutes):**

* Each group reflects on the AI output and shares how refining the prompt improved the results.
* Peers provide feedback on the clarity and effectiveness of the prompts.

#### **Section 3: Real-World Applications of Prompt Engineering (15 minutes)**

1. **AI in Different Industries (7 minutes)**

   * Discuss real-world applications where prompt engineering can enhance business processes.
   * **Examples include:**

     * **Customer Service:** Crafting prompts for chatbots to handle queries effectively.
     * **Marketing:** Using AI to generate targeted campaigns, content, or ad copy.
     * **Education:** Creating prompts for AI tutors to assist in personalized learning.
2. **Ethical Considerations in Prompt Engineering (8 minutes)**

   * Introduce the concept of **bias in AI** and how prompt engineering can affect the fairness of AI outputs.
   * Discuss the responsibility of AI users to ensure their prompts are ethical, clear, and respectful of privacy and inclusivity.

#### **Activity 2: AI Exploration and Testing (20 minutes)**

**Exploring AI Platforms:**

* Provide learners access to an AI platform like **ChatGPT** or **GPT-4** via a shared interface (e.g., OpenAI's API or other LLMs).
* Ask learners to input their newly created prompts, observe the outputs, and experiment with refining them.
* Optional: Use a **real dataset** (e.g., a text corpus, customer data, or business reports) to prompt the AI for analysis, summaries, or insights.

**Debrief:**

* Discuss common challenges faced during the activity (e.g., vague responses, lack of context).
* Encourage learners to share their insights and how they adapted their prompts to improve outputs.
