### **Section 1: Understanding the Basics of Prompt Engineering**

#### **1.1: Defining the Key Elements of a Prompt**

A successful prompt generally includes four core elements: **Context**, **Task**, **Constraints**, and **Format/Structure**.

**Exercise 1**: Fill in the blanks for each element of the following example prompt:

**Example Prompt**: "Write a 300-word blog post explaining the impact of climate change on coastal cities, including at least two real-world examples."

* **Context**: ___________________________________________________________
* **Task**: ___________________________________________________________
* **Constraints**: _______________________________________________________
* **Format/Structure**: ___________________________________________________

#### **1.2: Types of Prompts**

**Exercise 2**: Match each type of prompt with its use case:

| **Type of Prompt**          | **Use Case**                                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Open-ended prompt        | a. Generating product recommendations based on user input   |
| 2. Role-play prompt         | b. Summarizing a research paper                             |
| 3. Instruction-based prompt | c. Writing a story as if you're a detective solving a case  |
| 4. Task-specific prompt     | d. Asking for a list of benefits or challenges of a concept |

### **Section 2: Crafting Effective Prompts**

#### **2.1: Clarity and Precision**

**Exercise 3**: Review the following vague prompt and improve it by making it more specific. Provide your revised prompt below:

* **Vague Prompt**: "Tell me about AI."
* **Revised Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________

**Exercise 4**: Create a specific prompt for generating a blog post on AI in healthcare. Consider the **task**, **context**, and **format/structure** as you write it.

* **Specific Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________

#### **2.2: Context and Examples**

**Exercise 5**: How does providing context improve the quality of AI-generated responses?

* Write a vague question, then rewrite it by adding context and examples.

  * **Vague Question**: "What is digital marketing?"
  * **Revised with Context**: ___________________________________________________________

### **Section 3: Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques**

#### **3.1: Iterative Refining**

**Exercise 6**: Start with the following basic prompt. Then refine it by adding specificity, context, or constraints. Try to make the AI’s response more focused and relevant.

* **Basic Prompt**: "Tell me about the benefits of exercise."
* **Refined Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________

**Exercise 7**: Create an example where you start with an ambiguous or broad prompt and refine it step-by-step.

* **First Iteration**: "Tell me about sustainability."
* **Refined Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________

#### **3.2: Chain of Thought Prompting**

**Exercise 8**: Use **chain of thought prompting** for a complex task. Try to guide the AI through multiple steps. Example task: Explaining the impact of climate change on global agriculture.

* **Chain of Thought Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________

#### **3.3: Few-Shot Prompting**

**Exercise 9**: Create a few-shot prompt where you provide the AI with examples of a structured task (e.g., email writing). Here’s an example to follow:

* **Prompt**: "Write a professional email requesting a meeting with a colleague. Use the following examples as a guide:
  Example 1: ‘Dear [Name], I hope you are well. I would like to schedule a meeting...’
  Example 2: ‘Hi [Name], I trust you are doing well. I would like to discuss [Topic] at your earliest convenience...’"

* **Your Few-Shot Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________

### **Section 4: Real-World Applications of Prompt Engineering**

#### **4.1: AI for Marketing Campaigns**

**Exercise 10**: Create a prompt to generate ideas for a marketing campaign targeting eco-conscious consumers for a new sustainable product.

* **Marketing Campaign Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________

#### **4.2: AI for Data Analysis**

**Exercise 11**: You have a dataset containing sales data for the past year. Create a prompt to analyze the dataset and suggest business improvements.

* **Sales Analysis Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________

#### **4.3: AI for Customer Service**

**Exercise 12**: Create a prompt for a customer service chatbot to handle an inquiry about refund policies. The chatbot should give a clear, concise, and friendly answer.

* **Customer Service Chatbot Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________

### **Section 5: Ethical Considerations in Prompt Engineering**

#### **5.1: Bias in AI**

**Exercise 13**: In your own words, explain how prompt engineering can inadvertently lead to **bias in AI responses**. Provide an example of a biased prompt and how to avoid it.

* **Example of Biased Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________
* **How to Avoid Bias**: ___________________________________________________________

#### **5.2: Responsible Use of AI**

**Exercise 14**: Create a responsible prompt for generating a social media post on a controversial topic (e.g., climate change, political opinion). The post should be neutral, well-informed, and avoid inflammatory language.

* **Neutral Social Media Post Prompt**: ___________________________________________________________

---

### **Section 6: Testing and Refining Your Prompts**

#### **6.1: Testing Prompts**

**Exercise 15**: Test the following prompts using an AI platform (such as GPT-4 or ChatGPT). Record the outputs and refine your prompts as needed.

1. **Prompt 1**: "Write a paragraph on the importance of sleep."
2. **Prompt 2**: "List five creative ways to market a new smartphone."

* **AI Output (Prompt 1)**: ___________________________________________________________
* **AI Output (Prompt 2)**: ___________________________________________________________

**Refined Prompts**:
