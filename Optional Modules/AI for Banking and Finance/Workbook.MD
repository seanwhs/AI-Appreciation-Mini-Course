# **2. AI in Banking & Finance — The Big Picture**

Banking and finance are AI-ready because they rely on:

* Large structured datasets (transactions, accounts, loans)
* Unstructured data (news, call transcripts, social media)
* Risk analysis, fraud detection, regulatory compliance
* Predictive analytics for lending, investments, and customer behavior
* Repetitive operational workflows

**AI automates:** Routine, high-volume, rules-based tasks (transaction monitoring, credit scoring, reporting)
**Humans handle:** Strategic decisions, customer relationships, compliance interpretation, ethics

**Reflection Prompt:**
✏️ Which high-volume or repetitive tasks in your role could benefit from AI assistance?
