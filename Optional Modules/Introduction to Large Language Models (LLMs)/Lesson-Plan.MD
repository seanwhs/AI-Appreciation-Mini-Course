* **Hands-On Task (15 minutes):**

  * Break into small groups and ask participants to use an LLM tool to generate content (e.g., blog posts, marketing content, summaries).
  * Encourage them to iterate and refine their prompts to improve the output.

* **Group Sharing (5 minutes):**

  * Groups share their prompts and generated outputs, discussing what worked well and what could be improved.

* Understand how LLMs can be used to summarize large amounts of text and translate languages.

**Activities:**

* **Demonstration (10 minutes):**

  * Show how to input long texts (articles, reports) into LLMs for summarization.
  * Provide an example of a translation task (e.g., translating English to Spanish).
* **Hands-On Task (15 minutes):**

  * Participants choose a piece of content (e.g., a news article or report) and use the LLM to summarize it.
  * Optionally, they can translate text to another language using the AI.
* **Group Reflection (5 minutes):**
