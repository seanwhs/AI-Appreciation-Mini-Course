# **AI in Customer Service — The Big Picture**

Customer service teams manage many responsibilities including answering inquiries, troubleshooting issues, processing requests, documenting cases, and communicating clearly. Much of this work involves:

* **Repetition** (common questions, password resets, tracking updates)
* **Information retrieval** (policies, product details, account data)
* **Time-sensitive tasks** (escalations, SLAs, complaint handling)
* **Emotionally sensitive interactions** (angry or confused customers)
* **Documentation and summarization** (case notes, ticket logs)

AI helps reduce response times, improve answer accuracy, and support agents while preserving human empathy where it matters most.

### **AI automates:**

✓ Answering FAQs
✓ Drafting responses
✓ Routing and prioritizing tickets
✓ Summarizing calls and chats
✓ Detecting sentiment or urgency
✓ Suggesting solutions from a knowledge base
✓ Translating messages
✓ Predicting customer needs

### **Humans handle:**

* Emotional intelligence: empathy, active listening
* Complex or sensitive problem-solving
* Judgment in ambiguous situations
* Relationship building and tone calibration
* Final decisions on escalations

AI **supports** the agent—not replaces them.
