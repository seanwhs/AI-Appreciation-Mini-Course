# 📘 **Workbook — AI for Healthcare**

**Target Audience:** Clinicians, administrators, health informaticians, operational managers
**Approx. Duration:** 90–120 minutes

---

# **1. Learning Goals**

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

✔ Identify where AI is embedded across clinical, operational, and administrative workflows
✔ Recognize tasks AI can automate or augment (documentation, coding, scheduling, risk stratification)
✔ Use agentic AI for workflow simulations, triage, and protocol testing
✔ Partner with AI to improve patient care, reduce errors, and enhance operational efficiency
✔ Apply hands-on AI-driven exercises to test clinical, administrative, and population health strategies

# **2. AI in Healthcare — The Big Picture**

Healthcare is AI-ready because of:

* Pattern recognition (imaging, lab results)
* Large structured/unstructured datasets (EHRs, claims)
* Risk stratification and predictive modeling
* Documentation and coding
* Repetitive administrative workflows

**AI automates:** Documentation, coding, scheduling, triage, billing, and claims review
**Humans handle:** Clinical judgment, patient communication, complex diagnostics, care planning, ethical decisions

**Reflection Prompt:**
✏️ Which repetitive or high-volume tasks in your healthcare role could benefit from AI assistance?

# **4. Activity — “Where Can AI Strengthen Your Healthcare Practice?”**

**Instructions:**

1. List 5–7 clinical or administrative tasks
2. Evaluate each task using AI suitability criteria:

* High-volume data
* Repetitive or rules-based
* Risk of human error
* Real-time or predictive needs
* Time-sensitive decisions
* Documentation-heavy

Tasks meeting **2+ criteria** are strong candidates for AI augmentation.
