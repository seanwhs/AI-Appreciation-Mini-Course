# **AI for Healthcare**

## **Goal of This Module**

* **Where AI already appears in healthcare workflows**
* **Which tools and platforms enable AI-assisted clinical, administrative, and operational tasks**
* **What tasks AI can automate, augment, or accelerate**

# **AI in Healthcare — The Big Picture**

Healthcare is increasingly data-driven, making it highly AI-ready because so much of the work depends on:

* Pattern recognition (medical imaging, lab results)
* Large structured and unstructured datasets (EHRs, claims)
* Risk stratification and predictive modeling
* Documentation and coding
* Repetition in administrative workflows

AI excels in these environments and reduces manual workload while enhancing precision.
But **AI does not replace healthcare professionals**—it shifts them from data gatherers to interpreters, decision-makers, and patient-care strategists.

### **AI automates:**

Repetitive, high-volume, error-prone tasks like coding, scheduling, triage, and documentation.

### **Humans handle:**

Clinical judgment, patient communication, ethical decisions, complex diagnostics, care planning, and regulatory compliance.

Most modern EHRs, radiology systems, and health analytics platforms already contain embedded AI—sometimes transparently, sometimes “behind the scenes.”
