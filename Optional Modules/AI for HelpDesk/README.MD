# **AI in HelpDesk — The Big Picture**

Helpdesk teams manage tasks such as resolving technical issues, responding to tickets, assisting users with software or hardware, and maintaining documentation. Many tasks are:

* **Repetitive** (password resets, common troubleshooting)
* **Information-heavy** (knowledge base searches, system status checks)
* **Time-sensitive** (urgent tickets, SLA compliance)
* **Decision-making intensive** (diagnosing issues, escalation)

AI can reduce workload, speed up responses, and allow human agents to focus on complex problem-solving and user interaction.

### **AI automates:**

* Ticket classification and routing
* FAQs and routine troubleshooting
* System monitoring and alerts
* Knowledge base suggestions
* Summarizing tickets and chat transcripts
* Predictive issue detection

### **Humans handle:**

* Complex problem-solving and critical decisions
* Escalations and system-wide incident response
* Communication requiring empathy or negotiation
* Policy compliance and security-sensitive decisions
