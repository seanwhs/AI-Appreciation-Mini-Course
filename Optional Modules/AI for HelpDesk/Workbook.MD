---

### **3.2 Troubleshooting & Knowledge Base Suggestions**

**Scenario:**
User reports: “I cannot print from my workstation; the printer keeps showing offline.”

**Tasks:**

1. Write **your troubleshooting steps**:

---

2. Use AI to suggest steps. Paste AI output here:

---

3. Evaluate AI suggestions for **accuracy, clarity, and completeness**:

---

---

### **3.3 Automated Responses / Chatbot**

**Scenario:**
Frequent requests for password resets.

**Tasks:**

1. Write your own email response:

---

2. Use AI to generate a response or chatbot flow:

---

---

---

### **3.4 Ticket Summarization**

**Scenario:**
A ticket contains a long chat transcript about software installation failure.

**Tasks:**

1. Summarize manually in 2–3 sentences:

---

2. Use AI to summarize the ticket:

---

3. Compare: Did AI capture the key issue and urgency?

---

---

## **Section 4: Ethics, Security, and Best Practices**

### **4.1 Identifying Risks**

Check all potential risks of using AI in helpdesk:
