## Course Content Overview

### **1. AI in Industry Contexts**

This module introduces how AI is driving transformation across key industries. AI-powered tools are improving efficiency, enabling innovation, and redefining business operations. Topics covered include:

* **Healthcare:** AI-driven diagnostics, medical imaging, patient data management, and personalized treatment plans.
* **Finance:** AI applications in fraud detection, algorithmic trading, credit scoring, and risk management.
* **Manufacturing:** Predictive maintenance, robotics, supply chain optimization, and process automation.
* **Technology & IT:** AI applications in cybersecurity, software development, and AI-based tools for IT infrastructure management.

### **2. Industry-Specific Labs & Collaboration with Clients**

Certain **Industry-Specific Labs** may require access to proprietary commercial products and tools that are not always available to trainers during course development, particularly when using AI tools like **ChatGPT** or **Gemini**. These labs provide learners with practical experience in real-world scenarios, offering deeper insights into how AI is applied within specific industries.

Since some AI tools require **Long-Term Usage (LTU)** licenses or subscriptions, trainers may not always have immediate access to these resources. In such cases, trainers can collaborate with clients who possess the necessary licenses and tools, ensuring that the lab exercises are aligned with industry standards and offer the most current and relevant learning experience.

#### Example Collaborations:

* **Healthcare:** Trainers partner with hospitals and medical providers that have access to medical imaging software, allowing learners to work with real medical datasets.
* **Finance:** Trainers collaborate with financial institutions to provide learners with access to analytics platforms, facilitating exercises in fraud detection and risk management.

Working with clients ensures that trainers can customize labs and activities to meet industry-specific needs, offering hands-on learning experiences that are both practical and valuable.
