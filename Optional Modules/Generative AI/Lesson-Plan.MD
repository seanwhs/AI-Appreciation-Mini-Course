## **Lesson Outline:**

### **1. Introduction to Generative AI (15 minutes)**

**Objective:** Introduce the concept of Generative AI and explain how it works.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Warm-Up (5 minutes):**

   * Ask the participants: "Have you heard of AI that can create new content like text, images, or music? How do you think that works?"
   * Briefly introduce **Generative AI** as technology that creates new content based on existing data, different from traditional AI which classifies or predicts data.

2. **Presentation (10 minutes):**

   * Define **Generative AI**: "Generative AI refers to AI that can generate content such as text, images, music, and video from learned patterns."
   * Introduce **Key Concepts**:

     * **Training Data:** The large datasets AI uses to learn patterns.
     * **Generative Models (e.g., GANs, Transformers):** AI algorithms used to generate new content.
     * **Neural Networks:** AI systems that simulate the brain's neural processing to understand and create data.
   * Provide examples of Generative AI:

     * **Text Generation** (e.g., ChatGPT for stories, essays)
     * **Image Generation** (e.g., DALL-E for artwork)
     * **Music Generation** (e.g., AIVA for classical compositions)

### **2. How Generative AI Works (20 minutes)**

**Objective:** Explain the core mechanics of how Generative AI works and how it’s different from other types of AI.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Deep Dive into Key Concepts (10 minutes):**

   * **Training Data & Neural Networks:** Explain how Generative AI is trained on vast amounts of data to learn patterns (e.g., how GPT-3 learns language or how DALL-E learns visual styles).
   * **Generative Models:** Highlight how models like GANs and Transformers work. In GANs, two neural networks—one generates content, the other critiques it—improving over time.
2. **Interactive Example (10 minutes):**

   * Show a demo of **GPT-3** in action (e.g., ChatGPT) and **DALL-E**. Generate a piece of text (like a short story or poem) and an image (e.g., a futuristic city) based on a user input.
   * **Explain the process:** Input a prompt, AI generates content, and discuss how it arrived at that outcome.

### **3. Applications of Generative AI (20 minutes)**

**Objective:** Explore real-world applications of Generative AI in different fields.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Presentation (10 minutes):**

   * **Music Generation:**

     * Showcase how AI can compose original music, both instrumental and vocal, in different genres (e.g., AIVA, OpenAI Jukedeck).
   * **Video and Animation Generation:**

     * Discuss AI-generated videos and animations (e.g., Runway ML, Deepfake Technology).
     * Explain how deepfakes are made and raise concerns about authenticity and misinformation.

2. **Discussion (10 minutes):**

   * Ask participants: "In which industries or areas do you think Generative AI could be the most useful?"
   * Discuss applications in **advertising**, **education**, **entertainment**, **art**, and **healthcare**.
   * Encourage participants to share any creative uses of AI they’ve encountered or imagined.

### **4. Hands-On Experiment with Generative AI Tools (30 minutes)**

**Objective:** Give participants the opportunity to experiment with various Generative AI tools.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Text Generation with GPT-3 (or ChatGPT) (7 minutes):**

   * Participants will visit a platform like **ChatGPT** or **OpenAI Playground**.
   * Prompt the AI to write a short story, poem, or news article based on a creative input.
   * Example prompts: "Write a poem about winter," or "Generate a short story about a robot in a futuristic city."

2. **Image Generation with DALL-E or MidJourney (7 minutes):**

   * Participants will visit **DALL-E** or **MidJourney**.
   * Provide a detailed text description (e.g., “A forest with glowing trees and a waterfall under a purple sky”).
   * Generate an image based on the description and experiment with refining prompts.

3. **Music Generation with AIVA or OpenAI Jukedeck (7 minutes):**

   * Participants will visit **AIVA** or **Amper Music**.
