# **AI in Tabletop Exercises — The Big Picture**

Tabletop Exercises (TTX) are vital for preparing organizations to respond to cybersecurity incidents by simulating realistic attack scenarios in a controlled environment. Many aspects of these exercises can benefit from AI integration due to the need for:

* **Real-time scenario adaptation** (evolving attack vectors or defensive strategies)
* **Data analysis** (tracking team responses, identifying gaps in processes, etc.)
* **Pattern recognition** (identifying decision-making trends or communication breakdowns)
* **Repetitive tasks** (such as documentation, reporting, or scoring)
* **Collaboration facilitation** (between multiple teams and departments)

AI can significantly **augment human decision-making** by automating certain tasks, providing real-time insights, and helping teams explore complex scenarios more effectively. AI-driven tools help create more dynamic, responsive, and realistic exercises.

### **AI automates:**

Scenario updates, threat intelligence integration, incident documentation, scoring, and reporting.

### **Humans handle:**

Strategic decision-making, communication, high-level response tactics, and coordination among teams during an exercise.

Modern TTX platforms increasingly leverage AI to offer more adaptable and engaging scenarios, where analysts and decision-makers collaborate with AI to refine their response strategies.
