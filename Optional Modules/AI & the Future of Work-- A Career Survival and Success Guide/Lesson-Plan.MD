# ⭐ **Lesson Plan — “AI & the Future of Work” Module**

**Duration:** 90–120 minutes
**Format:** Instructor-led, virtual or in-person
**Audience:** Job seekers, career changers, professionals, students

---

# **1. Learning Objectives (5 minutes)**

Open the session by stating that, by the end of the module, learners will be able to:

* Explain how AI reshapes industries and job functions
* Identify jobs and tasks most vulnerable to automation
* Spot emerging roles and new AI-driven opportunities
* Evaluate what makes a task “AI-resistant” vs. “AI-accelerated”
* Understand the skills and mindsets needed to thrive
* Use AI as a daily collaborator for productivity & creativity

**Instructor Note:** Emphasize that the goal is not to fear AI, but to *use it as leverage*.

---

# **2. Icebreaker — “Your AI Encounters” (5 minutes)**

Ask learners:

**“What’s one way AI has already shown up in your work or life—expected or unexpected?”**

Common examples: autocomplete, recommendation systems, AI chat support, AI-generated images, etc.

**Purpose:** Normalize AI as something already here and relatable.

---

# **3. Lecture — The Big Picture (10 minutes)**

Use slides or visuals to cover:

### **AI does well:**

* Structured, repetitive tasks
* Pattern recognition
* Data summarization
* Drafting content (text, images, video)

### **Humans do well:**

* Ambiguity
* Ethical reasoning
* Creativity
* Relationship building
* Cross-disciplinary problem framing

**Key Insight:**
The future isn’t “AI vs. humans”—it’s **AI + humans**.

---

# **4. Industry Deep-Dive (20 minutes)**

Present the **6 industries**, each with:

* What AI does
* Real-world use cases
* Tools
* Human role

You can show 1–2 examples per industry to keep it focused.

### Suggested Presentation Flow:

1. Administration & Operations
2. Marketing & Creative
3. Manufacturing & Logistics
4. Healthcare & Life Sciences
5. Finance, Legal & Professional Services
6. Education & Training

**Instructor Tip:** Emphasize that AI **changes tasks**, not entire professions.

---

# **5. Discussion — “What surprised you?” (5 minutes)**

Ask:

*Which industry example felt closest to your job or interests? Why?*
*Which examples felt most disruptive?*

Encourage cross-industry insight.

---

# **6. High-Risk vs. High-Opportunity Jobs (10 minutes)**

### **High Automation Risk Jobs:**

Data entry, admin support, telemarketing, junior analyst roles, proofreaders, basic content writers, customer support, schedulers, etc.

Explain **why** risk is high: predictable, repetitive patterns.

### **Emerging & Expanding AI Roles:**

AI trainers, data annotators, AI workflow designers, risk officers, robot techs, AI-augmented creatives, etc.

### **Hybrid Roles (“AI + Human”)**

Project managers with AI copilots, AI-assisted paralegals, AI-powered marketers, analysts using AI for insights.

**Key Insight:**
Most jobs evolve into *hybrid roles*, not entirely new ones.

---

# **7. Mini-Activity — “Task Analysis Warm-Up” (10 minutes)**

Learners individually write down **3 tasks** they do in a typical day.

Ask them to categorize each as:

* **Automate** (AI could fully handle it)
* **Augment** (AI assists; human judges)
* **Human-led** (requires judgment, empathy, creativity)

**Optional Share Out:** Invite 2–3 learners to discuss their results.

---

# **8. Skills for Staying Relevant (10 minutes)**

Cover the seven essential skill areas:

1. **AI Literacy**
2. **Critical thinking & problem framing**
3. **Creativity & innovation**
4. **Communication & collaboration**
5. **Adaptability & continuous learning**
6. **Data competence**
7. **Ethical & responsible AI use**

Give simple examples:

*Prompting = asking better questions*
*Critical thinking = checking AI’s assumptions*
*Adaptability = learning new tools regularly*

---

# **9. Attitudes for Thriving in the AI Age (5 minutes)**

Discuss key mindsets:

* AI is a teammate
* Experiment over perfection
* Lifelong learning
* Comfort with change
* Human-first thinking
* Proactive ownership

This section sets the emotional/psychological tone.

---

# **10. Main Activity — “AI Futures Map for Your Career” (20–25 minutes)**

Provide the worksheet or digital template.
Learners complete the following steps:

### **Step 1: List 5–7 tasks from their current/desired role**

### **Step 2: Rate each task on**

* Repetition
* Predictability
* Rules-based structure
* Time volume
* Value to the business

### **Step 3: Categorize tasks**

* **Automate**
* **Augment**
* **Human-led**

### **Step 4: Draft a future-ready version of their role**

Prompt examples:

* “AI handles X so I can spend more time doing Y.”
* “My role shifts from execution to strategy.”
* “I use AI to generate drafts but I own final judgment.”

### **Optional Group Sharing**

Learners share their redesigned role in pairs or small groups.

---

# **11. Reflection Prompt (3 minutes)**

Ask learners to write:

**“What is one skill you commit to developing to stay AI-ready?”**

Collect them (optional) to revisit later.

---

# **12. Module Summary (5 minutes)**

Reinforce:

* AI is reshaping every industry
* Repetitive or predictable work is most vulnerable
* New hybrid and AI-native jobs are emerging
* Human strengths—judgment, empathy, creativity—are rising in value
* AI-literate workers will have a competitive advantage
* Career success comes from partnering with AI—not competing with it

---

# **13. Optional Assignment (Post-Class)**

**Assignment: “AI-Enhanced Workday Challenge”**

Learners must:

1. Use any generative AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
2. Apply it to a real task (draft email, summarize report, brainstorm ideas, plan project)
3. Write a brief reflection:

* What went well?
* What still required human judgment?
* How would you use AI differently next time?
