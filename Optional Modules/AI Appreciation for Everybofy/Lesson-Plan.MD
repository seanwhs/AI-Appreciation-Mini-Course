#### **Activities:**

1. **Warm-Up (5 minutes):**

   * Ask the participants: "What do you know about AI? Have you used AI today?"
   * Introduce AI as more than a "future technology" — it's already integrated into daily life.

2. **Presentation (10 minutes):**

   * Define AI simply: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to technology that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence."
   * Show how AI is embedded in everyday tools: voice assistants (Siri, Alexa), smart thermostats (Nest), healthcare apps (Fitbit), and entertainment recommendations (Netflix, Spotify).
   * Explain how AI helps us make smarter, easier decisions and perform tasks more efficiently.

### **2. How AI Improves Daily Life (20 minutes)**

**Objective:** Show practical applications of AI that simplify daily tasks.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Presentation (10 minutes):**

   * **Voice Assistants** (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri): Automate tasks like setting reminders, controlling home devices, and getting information.
   * **Health and Wellness** (Fitbit, Apple Health): Monitor activity, sleep, and provide reminders for medications and appointments.
   * **Smart Homes and Security** (Nest, Ring, Philips Hue): Control home devices (lighting, thermostat), increase home security, and enhance convenience.
   * **Entertainment** (Netflix, Spotify, Zoom): Recommend personalized content, facilitate video calls, and enhance social experiences.
   * **Learning and Growth** (Duolingo, Coursera, Lumosity): Provide educational resources and brain-training exercises for personal development.

2. **Group Discussion (10 minutes):**

   * Break the class into small groups and ask each group to focus on one AI application (e.g., voice assistants, health tools, smart homes).
   * Let them discuss:

     * How does this AI improve daily life?
     * How easy or difficult do you think it would be to use this AI?
     * Can you think of other uses for AI in this area?
   * Have each group share their findings with the class.

### **3. Hands-On AI Experience (25 minutes)**

**Objective:** Allow participants to interact with AI tools and see their benefits firsthand.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Voice Assistants Challenge (10 minutes):**

   * Ask participants to interact with a voice assistant (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri) and perform tasks such as:

     * Set a reminder
     * Ask for the weather
     * Control smart lights or other devices
   * Encourage participants to try a variety of tasks.

2. **Smart Home Demo (10 minutes):**

   * Set up a smart device (e.g., Nest Thermostat or Ring Doorbell) and demonstrate its use.
   * Allow participants to interact with the smart home technology by adjusting settings like temperature or checking a live feed from a camera.

3. **Learning App Exploration (5 minutes):**

   * Let participants explore a learning tool like **Duolingo** (language learning) or **Lumosity** (brain training).
   * Ask them to try a short activity and experience how AI personalizes their learning path or cognitive exercises.

### **4. Ethical Considerations and AI Safety (15 minutes)**

**Objective:** Raise awareness about the ethical implications and safety concerns of using AI.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Presentation (7 minutes):**

   * Discuss key ethical considerations:

     * **Privacy:** How AI can collect and use personal data.
     * **Bias:** How AI can perpetuate biases if trained on biased data.
     * **Security:** The potential risks of smart devices being hacked.
   * Introduce the concept of **human oversight**—AI should assist, not replace, human decision-making.

2. **Interactive Discussion (8 minutes):**

   * Ask participants:

     * Do you think AI can ever make decisions better than humans? Why or why not?
     * What are the risks of using AI in personal or professional life?
     * How can we ensure that AI is used ethically and safely?
   * Write key thoughts on the whiteboard to summarize the discussion.

### **5. Activity — "Discover AI Together" (15 minutes)**

**Objective:** Let participants experiment with AI tools to better understand their capabilities and applications.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Voice Assistant Challenge (5 minutes):**

   * In small groups or pairs, ask participants to try out various tasks on a voice assistant (e.g., Alexa or Google Assistant), such as:

     * Setting an alarm for the next day
     * Asking for a recipe
     * Controlling a smart home device (if available)

2. **Smart Home Demo (5 minutes):**

   * Show how a smart device can be controlled using voice commands or an app (e.g., adjusting thermostat settings or locking doors).
