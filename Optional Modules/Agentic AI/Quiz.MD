## **Section 3 — Short Answer (8 Questions)**

1. Define Agentic AI in your own words.
   **Sample Answer:** AI that acts autonomously to achieve goals, makes decisions, and adapts to its environment.

2. List three key characteristics of Agentic AI.
   **Sample Answer:** Autonomy, goal-orientation, adaptability, decision-making ability.

3. Give one real-world example of Agentic AI in robotics or automation.
   **Sample Answer:** Warehouse robots that sort and package items autonomously.

4. Describe how reinforcement learning works in simple terms.
   **Sample Answer:** The AI learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for successful actions and penalties for mistakes, improving over time.

5. Name two ethical concerns related to Agentic AI.
   **Sample Answer:** Bias in decision-making, accountability for errors, security vulnerabilities, human oversight.

6. How does an autonomous vehicle use Agentic AI to navigate safely?
   **Sample Answer:** It collects sensor data, identifies obstacles, predicts outcomes, and makes driving decisions independently.

7. Explain why human oversight is still important with Agentic AI.
   **Sample Answer:** Humans ensure safety, ethical compliance, and intervene if AI makes errors or unexpected decisions.

8. Provide one potential application of Agentic AI in finance and explain its benefit.

## **Section 4 — Scenario-Based / Reflection Questions (4 Questions)**

1. Imagine an AI agent is managing a small company’s customer service autonomously. What are three potential risks, and how would you mitigate them?
   **Sample Answer:** Errors in responses → oversight and monitoring; biased treatment → use diverse training data; system hacking → implement security measures.

2. You are testing an agentic AI robot in a warehouse. It starts making decisions that reduce efficiency. How would you address this?
   **Sample Answer:** Adjust its reward system, monitor decisions, retrain with updated data, and maintain human supervision.

3. Consider an autonomous trading AI that made a poor investment. Who should be accountable and why?
   **Sample Answer:** The organization deploying the AI or responsible human operators, because humans set goals and parameters.

4. Reflect on a task in your daily life that could be delegated to Agentic AI. What safeguards would you implement?
   **Sample Answer:** Example: Scheduling meetings — safeguards: double-check critical appointments, maintain human approval for conflicts, monitor outputs.
