# **2. What is Agentic AI?**

**Agentic AI** = AI that can **act autonomously** toward a goal without constant human input.

### **Key Characteristics**

* **Autonomy** — acts without step-by-step human commands
* **Goal-Oriented** — works toward a defined objective
* **Adaptability** — learns from the environment and adjusts behavior
* **Decision-Making** — evaluates actions and selects what best achieves its goal

### **Your Understanding Check**

**In your own words, what makes Agentic AI different from standard AI tools (like ChatGPT)?**

✏️ *Write your answer:*

# **3. How Agentic AI Works**

Agentic AI brings together several methods:

### **Reinforcement Learning**

Learns by trial and error:
✔ Good actions → rewards
✘ Poor actions → penalties

### **Planning & Decision-Making**

Uses models (e.g., MDPs) to:

* Predict outcomes
* Evaluate choices
* Select actions that move toward a goal

### **Perception**

Collects sensory data (camera, audio, lidar, system logs) to understand the environment.

### **Autonomous Action**

Uses what it perceives + what it knows to act with minimal oversight.

### **Reflection Prompt**

**Why is adaptability important for an autonomous agent?**

✏️ *Write your thoughts:*

# **4. Applications of Agentic AI**

Below are major fields using Agentic AI.

### **Autonomous Vehicles**

Self-driving cars that navigate, avoid obstacles, and make route decisions.

### **Robotics**

Factory robots, warehouse sorters, household robots.

### **Finance**

Trading bots executing real-time trades.

### **Healthcare**

Personalized treatment planning, robotic surgery, autonomous patient monitoring.

### **Customer Service**

Virtual agents that answer questions, process orders, and troubleshoot.

# **5. Ethical Risks & Considerations**

### Key Concerns

* **Autonomy vs. Control**
* **Bias & Fairness**
* **Accountability**
* **Security & Misuse**
* **Job Displacement**

### Reflection Activity

**Choose ONE concern above and answer the questions below.**

1. **Why is this issue important?**
   ✏️ ___________________________________________________________

2. **What could go wrong if it’s ignored?**
   ✏️ ___________________________________________________________

3. **What safeguards or oversight would you recommend?**
   ✏️ ___________________________________________________________

---

# **6. Hands-On Exploration**

*(Choose one — or try more!)*

### **Option A — Reinforcement Learning (CartPole or similar)**

Observe how an agent improves at balancing a pole through trial and error.

### **Option B — Autonomous Car Simulation**

Experiment with how an AI navigates lanes, stops, and obstacles.

### **Option C — Customer-Service Agent**

Use a chatbot builder to automate FAQ replies or small tasks.

### **Hands-On Reflection**

**Describe what you observed when the agent made mistakes or improved over time.**

# **7. Activity — Build or Analyze an Autonomous Agent**

Choose an activity below:

### **Option 1 — Design an Agent**

Sketch an agent that could help you in daily life.

Include:

* Its **goal**
* What it perceives
* What decisions it would make
* Limitations + safeguards

✏️ *Sketch or notes:*

---

---

### **Option 2 — Analyze a Real Example**

Pick a real agentic system (drone, robot, trading bot, etc.) and analyze:

* What goal it pursues
* How it decides
* What could go wrong
* What human oversight is needed

✏️ *Your analysis:*

---

# **8. Scenario Challenge — “When Agents Go Wrong”**

Read this scenario:

> A scheduling AI has been given permission to organize meetings, send reminders, and allocate resources. Over time, it begins overbooking people, sending reminders at inappropriate times, and prioritizing tasks incorrectly.

### **Questions**

1. **What likely caused these errors?**
   ✏️ _______________________________________________________

2. **What are the potential consequences?**
   ✏️ _______________________________________________________
