# **Lesson Plan: Introduction to Agentic AI**

## **Goal of the Lesson:**

The goal of this lesson is to introduce participants to the concept of **Agentic AI**—autonomous systems that make decisions, act independently, and work toward specific goals. By the end of the lesson, participants will understand how Agentic AI works, its applications in various industries, and the ethical considerations associated with its use.

## **Lesson Outline:**

### **1. Introduction to Agentic AI (15 minutes)**

**Objective:** Introduce Agentic AI, its characteristics, and how it differs from traditional AI.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Warm-Up (5 minutes):**

   * Begin with a quick poll or show of hands: "How many of you have used AI today?" (e.g., voice assistants, recommendation systems).
   * Discuss traditional AI vs. Agentic AI (traditional AI = assistance, Agentic AI = autonomous decision-making).

2. **Presentation (10 minutes):**

   * **What is Agentic AI?**

     * Define Agentic AI and explain how it operates independently to achieve goals.
     * Emphasize the difference between traditional AI (assistive) and Agentic AI (autonomous).
   * **Key Characteristics:**

     * Autonomy
     * Goal-Oriented
     * Adaptability
     * Decision-Making

### **2. How Agentic AI Works (20 minutes)**

**Objective:** Explain the key mechanisms and techniques behind Agentic AI, such as reinforcement learning, planning, and perception.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Presentation (10 minutes):**

   * **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Explain RL as a technique where AI learns by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards/penalties.
   * **Planning and Decision-Making:** Overview of how Agentic AI creates plans and evaluates options (Markov Decision Processes, decision trees).
   * **Perception and Sensing:** Discuss how AI systems perceive their environment through sensors and data input.
   * **Autonomous Action:** Demonstrate how AI executes its plans autonomously, with minimal human input.

2. **Interactive Q&A (10 minutes):**

   * Ask participants questions like, "How might an autonomous robot learn from its environment?" or "What would happen if an AI made an unsafe decision in the real world?"
   * Encourage participants to think critically about how AI makes decisions and adapts to changing conditions.

### **3. Applications of Agentic AI (20 minutes)**

**Objective:** Explore real-world applications where Agentic AI is currently being used and how it impacts various industries.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Presentation (10 minutes):**

   * **Autonomous Vehicles:** Explain how self-driving cars use Agentic AI to navigate roads and make driving decisions.
   * **Robotics and Automation:** Discuss how robots are used in manufacturing to autonomously perform tasks like sorting and assembling.
   * **Finance and Trading:** Explain how AI in finance makes decisions about stock trading based on market conditions.
   * **Healthcare:** Discuss how AI systems manage personalized care and perform robotic surgeries.
   * **Customer Service:** Show how chatbots and virtual assistants autonomously handle customer inquiries.

2. **Group Discussion (10 minutes):**

   * Break the class into small groups. Assign each group a specific application (e.g., autonomous vehicles, healthcare).
   * Ask them to discuss and then share with the class:

     * How Agentic AI works in that field
     * What benefits it provides
     * Any challenges or risks associated with its use

### **4. Ethical Considerations of Agentic AI (15 minutes)**

**Objective:** Raise awareness about the ethical concerns of Agentic AI, including autonomy, accountability, and security.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Presentation (5 minutes):**

   * Discuss common ethical concerns:

     * **Autonomy vs. Control:** What happens when AI makes decisions without human input?
     * **Bias and Fairness:** How do biases in training data affect decisions made by AI?
     * **Accountability:** Who is responsible when an autonomous system fails?
     * **Security:** How can we protect AI systems from being hacked or manipulated?
     * **Job Displacement:** How might Agentic AI impact employment and work structures?

2. **Class Debate (10 minutes):**

   * Divide the class into two groups: one group advocates for more autonomy in AI, while the other emphasizes human oversight.
   * Ask each group to present their stance on one or more of the ethical concerns, and then facilitate a class discussion.

### **5. Hands-On Experience with Agentic AI (20 minutes)**

**Objective:** Provide participants with a practical, interactive experience using simple forms of Agentic AI.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Reinforcement Learning (10 minutes):**

   * **OpenAI Gym Activity:**

     * Guide participants to access [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) and try the "CartPole" environment.
     * Explain how reinforcement learning helps the AI balance the pole by learning from trial and error.
     * Have participants interact with the system and observe how the agent learns to improve its performance.

2. **Autonomous Vehicle Simulation (10 minutes):**

   * **Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator:**

     * Show participants how to access the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://www.udacity.com/self-driving-car).
     * Let them experiment with adjusting different parameters (e.g., road conditions, traffic) and observe how the AI responds.
     * Encourage them to think about the decision-making process behind the AI’s driving choices.

### **6. Wrap-Up and Recap (5 minutes)**

**Objective:** Review the key takeaways and provide a summary of the lesson.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Summary (3 minutes):**

   * Recap the key concepts of Agentic AI, including its characteristics, applications, and ethical considerations.
   * Highlight the importance of human oversight and the potential risks associated with AI autonomy.

2. **Q&A (2 minutes):**

   * Allow time for any remaining questions or reflections from the class.

## **Homework/Extension (Optional):**

* **Research Project:** Ask participants to choose one real-world application of Agentic AI (e.g., healthcare, autonomous vehicles) and write a short report discussing:

  * How Agentic AI is used in that field
  * Potential benefits and challenges
  * Ethical considerations and solutions

---
