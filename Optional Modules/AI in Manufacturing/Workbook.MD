# **2. AI in Manufacturing — The Big Picture**

Manufacturing is highly AI-ready because it involves:

* Monitoring and controlling large volumes of production data
* Predictive maintenance for machines and equipment
* Optimizing supply chains and inventory
* Detecting defects and ensuring quality control
* Repetition in operational and assembly line workflows

**AI automates:** Repetitive, high-volume tasks such as quality inspections, production scheduling, and inventory tracking
**Humans handle:** Process design, operational strategy, supply chain negotiation, safety oversight, and complex problem-solving

**Reflection Prompt:**
