### **2. AI-Powered Features in Excel (15-20 minutes)**

**A. Built-in AI Features in Excel (Microsoft 365)**
Modern versions of Excel (Microsoft 365) come with several AI features that help with automation and analysis:

1. **Ideas in Excel**:
   Excel can automatically analyze your data and suggest trends, patterns, and visualizations based on the dataset you have. This feature uses machine learning to understand the data context and recommend ways to visualize it.

   **How it Works:**

   * Select any cell within your data.
   * Go to the "Home" tab and click on the “Ideas” button.
   * Excel will provide smart insights, data patterns, and recommendations for charts, pivot tables, and more.

   **Activity**: Try the Ideas feature by selecting a dataset and exploring Excel’s suggestions.
   *Your Notes:*

   * Insights generated: ______________________________________________________
   * Visualizations recommended: ______________________________________________________

2. **Data Types (Power Query)**
   Excel can now recognize specific data types (e.g., geography, stocks) and automatically convert them into dynamic data linked to online sources.

   **How it Works:**

   * Type a list of country names or stock symbols in a column.
   * Select the column and choose **Insert > Data Types** (e.g., Stocks, Geography).
   * Excel links the column to live data from online sources.

   **Activity**: Convert a list of country names into a dynamic dataset with data like population, GDP, etc.
   *Your Notes:*

   * Data types used: ______________________________________________________
   * Information retrieved: ______________________________________________________

3. **Excel Formulas Enhanced with AI**
   AI in Excel can assist with complex formulas. Using **Dynamic Arrays** and **XLOOKUP**, Excel automatically adjusts ranges and calculates results faster than before.

   **Activity**: Try a formula suggestion in Excel to make dynamic ranges more efficient.
   *Your Notes:*

   * Formula used: ______________________________________________________
   * Result: ______________________________________________________

### **3. Leveraging AI for Data Analysis (20-25 minutes)**

**A. Predictive Analysis with AI**
One of the most powerful ways AI can be applied in Excel is through predictive analysis. Excel’s **Forecast Sheet** uses machine learning to analyze trends and predict future values based on historical data.

**How it Works:**

1. Select a data range (e.g., sales data over the past few years).
2. Go to **Data > Forecast Sheet**.
3. Excel will automatically generate a forecast for the data and create a new worksheet with predicted values.

**Activity**: Use the Forecast Sheet to predict future sales or expenses based on historical data.
*Your Notes:*

* Data used for forecasting: ______________________________________________________
* Prediction outcome: ______________________________________________________

**B. AI-Powered Excel Add-ins**
There are several add-ins available to integrate AI into Excel:

1. **Power BI Integration**:
   Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that can pull data from Excel into interactive reports, which use AI to detect patterns and provide insights.

2. **Azure Machine Learning Integration**:
   Using Azure Machine Learning, you can import trained AI models into Excel for advanced forecasting, classification, and data pattern recognition.

**Activity**: Install and explore the **Power BI** add-in to connect your Excel data to Power BI for advanced analytics.

### **4. Automating Repetitive Tasks with AI (15 minutes)**

**A. Automate with Macros and Power Automate**
AI in Excel can be combined with **Macros** or **Power Automate** to create workflows that automate repetitive tasks (e.g., sending reports, updating databases, or importing data).

1. **Recording Macros**:
   Excel allows you to record your actions and save them as macros to automate repetitive tasks. For example, if you regularly format data in a certain way, you can record a macro to perform that task automatically.

   **Activity**: Record a simple macro to automate formatting a data table.
   *Your Notes:*

   * Macro recorded: ______________________________________________________
   * Actions automated: ______________________________________________________

2. **Power Automate**:
   Power Automate allows you to create automated workflows for Excel, such as sending reminders, processing data, or emailing reports based on specific conditions.

   **Activity**: Create a basic automation (e.g., send an email when a specific condition is met in your Excel file).
   *Your Notes:*

   * Workflow created: ______________________________________________________
   * Automation tasks: ______________________________________________________

### **5. AI for Error-Checking and Data Cleansing (10-15 minutes)**

**A. Using AI to Detect Errors**
AI in Excel can help spot errors or inconsistencies in your data. It can recognize patterns and suggest corrections for issues like mismatched data types, incorrect values, or empty cells.

**How it Works:**
Excel automatically highlights potential data issues and uses AI to suggest corrections or fixes.

**Activity**: Check your data for errors using Excel’s **Data Validation** and **Error Checking** tools.
*Your Notes:*

* Errors detected: ______________________________________________________
* Suggestions provided: ______________________________________________________
