# **AI for Malware Analysis**

## **Goal of This Module**

Equip learners to recognize:

* **Where AI already appears in malware analysis workflows**
* **Which AI tools and platforms enable it**
* **What tasks AI can automate, augment, or accelerate**
* **How analysts can partner with AI** to improve threat detection, malware classification, reverse engineering, and incident response

# **AI in Malware Analysis — The Big Picture**

Malware analysis and threat intelligence are highly AI-ready because many tasks depend on:

* Pattern recognition (signatures, behaviors)
* Repetition (scanning, labeling, parsing logs)
* Large datasets (samples, threat feeds, telemetry)
* Rules-based logic (detection heuristics, sandboxing)
* Iterative analysis cycles (testing, reverse engineering, mitigation)

AI excels in these environments and **augments analyst expertise**, shifting the role from manual inspection to high-level investigation, threat hunting, and strategy.

### **AI automates:**

Sample classification, signature generation, behavior analysis, anomaly detection, and report generation.

### **Humans handle:**

Incident response strategy, malware attribution, advanced reverse engineering, ethical decision-making, and contextual threat assessment.

Modern malware analysis platforms increasingly embed AI—even if analysts interact with it indirectly.
