# **AI for Malware Analysis — Learner Workbook**

## **Goal of This Module**

By the end of this workbook, you will be able to:

* Identify **where AI appears in malware analysis workflows**
* Recognize **AI tools and platforms** that enhance analysis
* Understand **tasks AI can automate, augment, or accelerate**
* Learn how to **partner with AI** to improve threat detection, classification, reverse engineering, and reporting

---

## **1. AI in Malware Analysis — The Big Picture**

Malware analysis relies heavily on:

* **Pattern recognition** (signatures, behaviors)
* **Repetition** (scanning, labeling, parsing logs)
* **Large datasets** (samples, threat feeds, telemetry)
* **Rules-based logic** (heuristics, sandboxing)
* **Iterative analysis cycles** (testing, reverse engineering, mitigation)

**AI excels** in these tasks, allowing analysts to focus on strategic investigation.

**Activity:**
List 3 tasks in your current workflow that could benefit from AI automation:

1. ---
2. ---
3. ---

**Reflection:**
Which of these tasks are repetitive, error-prone, or time-consuming?

---

## **2. Malware Classification & Threat Detection**

**AI helps with:**

* Classifying files as malicious or benign
* Grouping malware into families
* Detecting novel/polymorphic malware
* Predicting threat severity

**Real Tools:** Cylance, CrowdStrike Falcon, VirusTotal Intelligence, Intezer Analyze

**Activity:**
Check all the classification tasks your team performs that could be automated:

☐ Triage new malware samples
☐ Identify unknown variants
☐ Prioritize threats by risk

**Notes / Observations:**

## **3. Static & Dynamic Analysis Automation**

**AI helps with:**

* Feature extraction from binaries, scripts, and macros
* Identifying suspicious API calls or behaviors
* Flagging anomalies in runtime traces
* Suggesting possible malicious intent

**Tools:** Cuckoo Sandbox AI plugins, Hybrid Analysis, Joe Sandbox, VMRay

**Exercise:**
Write down one example of a static and a dynamic analysis task that is currently slow or repetitive in your workflow:

* Static analysis task: _________________________
* Dynamic analysis task: _______________________

---

## **4. Reverse Engineering & Code Analysis Assistance**

**AI helps with:**

* Suggesting likely function behavior
* Identifying patterns in obfuscated code
* Generating pseudo-code explanations
* Highlighting suspicious control flows

**Tools:** Ghidra ML plugins, JEB Decompiler AI, Binary Ninja AI

**Activity — Reverse Engineering Reflection:**
Which part of reverse engineering do you find most time-consuming? How could AI help?

---

## **5. Threat Hunting & Behavior Analysis**

**AI helps with:**

* Detecting anomalies in logs or network traffic
* Correlating malware activity with threat intelligence
* Suggesting attack vectors or lateral movement
* Prioritizing alerts

**Tools:** Splunk ML Toolkit, Darktrace, Microsoft Sentinel AI, Elastic Security

**Exercise:**
List one example of a threat hunting alert that could benefit from AI correlation or prioritization:

---

---

## **6. Automated Reporting & Documentation**

**AI helps with:**

* Producing incident summaries
* Generating IOC lists (hashes, domains, IPs)
* Writing documentation for malware samples
* Suggesting remediation steps

**Tools:** Cortex XSOAR, MISP AI plugins, ThreatConnect AI

**Activity:**
Think of a report you generated recently. Which sections could AI have written automatically?

---

---

## **7. Learning & Malware Exploration (“Vibe Hunting”)**

**AI helps with:**

* Suggesting analysis experiments (sandbox runs, unpacking sequences)
* Explaining malware behaviors and techniques
* Providing contextual guidance during exploration
* Recommending detection strategies

**Tools:** Intezer Analyze, ReversingLabs AI, OpenAI Codex snippets

**Exercise:**
Describe one scenario where you could use AI to explore a new malware family:

---

---

## **8. Collaboration & Threat Intelligence Sharing**

**AI helps with:**

* Summarizing malware analysis for SOC teams
* Suggesting indicators for sharing
* Highlighting security gaps
* Generating compliance-ready reports

**Tools:** MISP, Recorded Future, ThreatConnect AI, Anomali AI

**Activity:**
List 2 ways AI could help your team share intelligence faster:

1. ---
2. ---

---

## **9. Activity — “Where Can AI Help Your Malware Analysis?”**

**Instructions:**

1. List 5–7 recurring malware analysis tasks.
2. Evaluate them against AI suitability:

* Repetitive
* Pattern-heavy
* Error-prone
* Time-consuming
* Documentation-heavy
* Alert-heavy
* Learning/prototyping

3. Assign AI Potential: Low / Medium / High

| Task | Criteria Met | AI Potential (Low/Med/High) |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
|      |              |                             |
|      |              |                             |
|      |              |                             |

**Reflection:**
Which tasks should you try automating first? Why?
