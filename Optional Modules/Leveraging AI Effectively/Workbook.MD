AI **augments human decision-making**, but outputs may be inconsistent or incomplete. Mastering **comparison, validation, and optimization** ensures reliability and creative leverage.

### **AI Automates**

* Draft generation: text, code, design, reports
* Data summarization, synthesis, and analysis
* Repetitive workflow tasks

### **Humans Handle**

* Critical evaluation and validation
* Ethical and strategic decisions
* Iterative refinement of prompts and outputs
* Creative synthesis and application

## **Activity — Compare, Validate, and Sharpen AI Outputs**

1. Choose a task (text summary, code, marketing email).
2. Generate outputs from 2–3 AI tools.
3. Compare for accuracy, clarity, style, completeness.
4. Validate against facts, code correctness, or logic.
5. Iteratively refine using prompt engineering.

| Task | Tools Used | Accuracy | Clarity | Completeness | Refinement Steps Taken |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
|      |            |          |         |              |                        |
