| 10 min | **Introduction**                                  | Lecture / Discussion     | Overview of AI output variability, importance of comparison and validation. Real-world examples.                                                   |
| 15 min | **AI Output Management — The Big Picture**        | Presentation             | Explain AI automation vs. human tasks. Discuss iterative prompting and human-AI collaboration.                                                     |
| 20 min | **Comparing AI Outputs Across Tools**             | Demonstration + Hands-on | Show outputs from ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Jasper AI. Learners generate outputs for a simple task and observe differences.                           |
| 15 min | **Validating AI Outputs**                         | Lecture + Pair Work      | Explain methods for fact-checking, verifying code, or testing analytics. Learners validate sample AI outputs against trusted sources.              |
| 20 min | **Sharpening AI Outputs with Prompt Engineering** | Demo + Practice          | Introduce iterative and successive prompting, contextual prompts, and style adjustments. Learners refine initial AI outputs.                       |
| 10 min | **Integrating AI Evaluation into Workflows**      | Discussion + Examples    | Show examples of research, marketing, and coding workflows. Discuss best practices for human-AI collaboration.                                     |
| 20 min | **Hands-on Activity: Compare, Validate, Sharpen** | Guided Practice          | Learners pick a task (text summary, marketing email, or code). Steps: generate outputs from 2–3 tools → compare → validate → refine using prompts. |
| 10 min | **Module Summary and Q&A**                        | Discussion               | Review key takeaways: comparison, validation, iterative refinement, workflow integration. Address questions.                                       |

## **Assessment / Exercises**

**Activity Table Template:**

| Task | Tools Used | Accuracy | Clarity | Completeness | Refinement Steps Taken |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
|      |            |          |         |              |                        |

**Case Studies for Practice:**

1. **Text Summarization:** Summarize a 3,000-word article, compare AI outputs, validate facts, refine iteratively.
2. **Marketing Copy Generation:** Generate multiple email or social media copy variations, compare, refine, and prepare for A/B testing.
3. **Code Snippet Generation:** Write a Python function, compare outputs, validate logic, and iteratively improve the code.
