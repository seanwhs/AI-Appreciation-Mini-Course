# 📘 **Module 2 Workbook — How AI Works**

**Estimated Time:** 60 minutes

# **Section 1 — Before We Begin**

### 🧠 *Warm-Up Reflection*

In your own words, what do you think it means for a computer to “learn”?
Write a few sentences:

---

---

### 💭 *Prediction Check*

Before you see the slides, guess:
**Which of these do you think AI uses to learn?**
(Check all you think apply.)

⬜ Rules that programmers manually write
⬜ Examples from data
⬜ Human-like intuition
⬜ Statistical patterns
⬜ Random guessing
⬜ Millions of images / texts / recordings

# **Section 2 — Machine Learning (ML)**

*(Slides 4)*

## 📝 **Worksheet: Understanding ML**

### **Fill-in-the-Blank: The ML Formula**

ML follows this basic idea:

> **Data → __________ → Predictions**

### **Sorting: Is It Machine Learning?**

Mark each example as **ML** or **Not ML**.

| Scenario                                             | ML / Not ML |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | :---------: |
| Your email learns which messages are spam            |     ___     |
| A vending machine gives change based on a fixed rule |     ___     |
| Netflix suggests a new show you might like           |     ___     |
| You flip a light switch and the light turns on       |     ___     |
| A medical AI finds patterns in X-rays                |     ___     |

### **Quick Reflection**

ML “learns from examples.” Write 1–2 examples of systems in your life that seem to learn:

# **Section 3 — Neural Networks**

*(Slide 5)*

## 🧠 **Worksheet: How Neural Networks Work**

### **Label the Simple Diagram**

Fill in the missing parts:

```
[data goes in] → [_________] → [_________] → [result/output]
      A              B              C
```

A = ____________________
B = ____________________
C = ____________________

### **Multiple Choice**

Neural networks are powerful because they:
A) Store emotions and experiences
B) Use many small transformations to detect complex patterns
C) Work exactly like a human brain
D) Use magic to guess the right answer

Correct answer: _______

### **Short Answer**

Why do deeper networks (more layers) understand more complex patterns?

# **Section 4 — Language Models**

*(Slide 6)*

## 📚 **Worksheet: Next-Word Prediction**

### **Core Idea Check**

Language models are trained to:
**Predict the next ______ in a ______.**

### **Prediction Exercise**

Fill in your own predictions:

1. *“The sun rises in the…”* → __________________
2. *“Please remember to bring your…”* → __________________
3. *“The capital of Japan is…”* → __________________

### **Reflection**

Why does predicting the next word help with tasks like summarization or translation?

---

---

### **True or False**

1. Language models “understand” facts the same way people do. — T / F
2. They learn patterns from large collections of text. — T / F
3. They can mimic tone or style based on examples. — T / F
4. They form personal opinions. — T / F

# **Section 5 — Putting It All Together**

## 🔄 **ML → Neural Networks → Language Models**

Match the description to the concept:

| Description                               |  ML | Neural Networks | Language Models |
| ----------------------------------------- | :-: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Predict the next word in a sentence       | ___ |       ___       |       ___       |
| Learn from examples                       | ___ |       ___       |       ___       |
| Use layers of “neurons” to transform data | ___ |       ___       |       ___       |

### **Concept Map (Draw Your Own)**

Sketch a simple diagram showing how ML, neural networks, and language models relate.
