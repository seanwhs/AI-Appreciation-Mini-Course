# 🚀 **QUIZ 3 — Challenge & Application Quiz (7 Questions)**

*Higher-order thinking, reflection, and real-world application.*

---

### **1. Short Answer:**

In your own words, explain why ML systems don’t “understand” the world like humans.

**Expected Response:**
Because ML identifies statistical patterns in data rather than forming awareness, intention, or real comprehension.

---

### **2. Scenario:**

Your email system keeps learning which messages are spam. This is an example of:

A. Hand-written rules
B. ML learning from examples
C. Conscious decision-making
D. A language model predicting stories

**Answer:** B

---

### **3. Short Answer:**

What role do “hidden layers” play in neural networks?

**Expected Response:**
They gradually transform and refine data, allowing the model to detect more complex patterns.

---

### **4. Scenario:**

A language model completes your sentence:
“You should bring an umbrella today because…” → “it might rain.”

Why does it predict “rain”?

A. It knows your local weather
B. It has seen the pattern “umbrella → rain” many times
C. It understands your feelings
D. It searched the internet for weather data

**Answer:** B

---

### **5. Explain This Misconception (Short Answer):**

“AI reads and understands text the same way humans do.”
Why is this incorrect?

**Expected Response:**
AI doesn’t understand meaning; it detects patterns and predicts likely next words, without awareness or real comprehension.

---

### **6. Real-Life Connection:**

Give one example of Machine Learning you’ve experienced today.

**Expected Answers:**
Autocorrect, social media feed ranking, recommendations, spam filters, search results, voice assistants, etc.

---

### **7. Reflection:**

After learning how AI works, what is **one new question** you now have about ML, neural networks, or language models?
